B.Maximum Number of Shares That May Vest.  Subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 13.2(a) of the Plan, the maximum number of Shares subject to a Tranche that may vest is equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of such Tranche’s Target Tranche Shares, and the maximum number of Shares subject to this Option that may vest is equal to the Maximum Number of Shares Subject to the Option as set forth above in this Grant Notice. 
 
C.Vesting.  The vesting of the Tranches will be subject to both the achievement of the Performance Goals and the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service through the specified date, as described in this Section II.C., subject to Section II.D. in connection with a Qualifying Termination, Section II.E in connection with the Optionee’s death or Disability, and Section II.F. in connection with a Change in Control.
 
1.Performance Period.  The period during which the Performance Goals applicable to a Tranche may be achieved begins with the Grant Date and ends on the Expiration Date, subject to earlier termination as set forth in this Grant Notice (the “Performance Period”).  If the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service terminates before the Expiration Date, then except to the extent provided in Sections II.D., II.E. and II.F. below, the Performance Period will terminate as of the date of termination of the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service and no Shares subject to this Option may vest based on any achievement of the Performance Goals that occurs after the date that the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service terminates.  Further, for clarity, Shares subject to this Option may become eligible to vest, and may vest, only while the Option (or applicable portion thereof) remains outstanding. 
2.Stock Price Goals.  For a Tranche to become eligible to vest, the Company must achieve an Average Price equal to at least the Stock Price Goal amount set forth opposite such Tranche in Table 1 above (each, a “Stock Price Goal”).  If the Company achieves the Stock Price Goal applicable to a Tranche (an “Achieved Tranche”), then the number of Shares that become eligible to vest will equal the Target Tranche Shares (and any Target Tranche Shares for a lower-numbered Tranche that did not previously vest), as adjusted by the Relative TSR Modifier set forth below.  The Stock Price Goal applicable to a Tranche may be achieved only once during the Performance Period, and accordingly, any achievement of an Achieved Tranche’s Stock Price Goal after such Stock Price Goal already has been achieved during the Performance Period will not result in any additional Shares becoming Eligible Shares, or vesting, with respect to such Achieved Tranche.  For the avoidance of doubt, more than one Tranche may be achieved in connection with an Achieved Tranche, if the applicable Stock Price Goals for those Tranches (to the extent not previously achieved) are less than the Stock Price Goal for the Achieved Tranche that is the subject of the performance determination. 
(a)Certain Adjustments.  In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, reclassification, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs (other than any ordinary dividends or other ordinary distributions), the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Option, will make appropriate adjustments to the Stock Price Goal(s) set forth in Table 1 above to the extent such Stock Price Goal(s) have not yet been achieved. 
3.Relative TSR Modifier.  Depending on the performance of the Company’s TSR relative to the TSR of the Index Companies, the number of Shares subject to a Tranche that can vest may be increased or decreased in accordance 
-2-
 
with the terms of this Section II.C.3. (the “Relative TSR Modifier”).  The resulting number of Shares as so adjusted by the Relative TSR Modifier are referred to herein as “Eligible Shares”). 
(a)TSR of the Company.  With respect to any Achieved Tranche, the TSR of the Company will be determined by comparing (x) the Average Price that ends with, and is inclusive of, the date that the Company achieves the Stock Price Goal for such Achieved Tranche (the “Stock Price Achievement Date”), to (y) the Company Base Price (that is, the difference between the quotient of (y) divided by (x), minus one (1)).  The Company’s TSR will be expressed as a percent of increase (i.e., a positive percent) or decrease (i.e., a negative percent) as compared to the Company Base Price. 
(b)TSR of Index Companies.  The TSR of each Index Company will be determined by comparing (x) the Index Company Price of such Index Company that ends with, and is inclusive of, the Stock Price Achievement Date for the applicable Achieved Tranche, to (y) the Index Base Price of such Index Company (that is, the difference between the quotient of (y) divided by (x), minus one (1)).  Each Index Company’s TSR will be expressed as a percent of increase (i.e., a positive percent) or decrease (i.e., a negative percent) as compared to the Index Base Price for such Index Company.
(c)Dividends.  For purposes of determining the prices under clauses (x) and (y) in the TSR of each of the Company and the Index Companies, the value of any dividends and other distributions will be treated as reinvested in additional shares of the applicable traded stock at the closing sales price on the applicable ex-dividend date (or if there was no closing sales price on such date, the closing sales price on the last date on which a closing sales price occurred).
(d)Relative TSR.  The Company’s TSR will be ranked against the TSRs of the Index Companies as of the Stock Price Achievement Date applicable to such Achieved Tranche, with the highest positive TSR ranked the highest and the highest negative TSR ranked the lowest, as provided in this Section II.C.3(d). For each Stock Price Achievement Date, a total of three calculations under the preceding sentence shall be performed, with each of such calculations assessing the Index Base Price using a different of the three potential Measurement Base Dates applicable to the relevant Stock Price Achievement Date. The calculated result (of the three calculations) that results in the highest percentile ranking for the Company will be used for purposes of the Relative TSR Modifier. If the Company achieves the percentile achievement of TSR relative to the Index Companies’ TSRs (“Relative TSR”) set forth in Table 2 below, then the Target Tranche Shares will be adjusted by the percentage set forth next to the applicable percentile achievement set forth in Table 2:  
Table 2




If the Company’s Percentile Achievement of 
Relative TSR is: 

…Then the Target Tranche Shares Will Be Adjusted by the Following Percentage 

Less Than the 50th Percentile

-20% 

Equal to or Greater Than the 50th Percentile

0%

Equal to or Greater Than the 75th Percentile

+20%

 
If the Company achieves Relative TSR that is greater than the 50th percentile but less than the 75th percentile, then the percentage adjustment will be made based on linear interpolation between a 0% adjustment (at the 50th percentile) and a +20% adjustment (at the 75thpercentile).  As an example, if the Company achieves Relative TSR at the 70th percentile, then the Target Tranche Shares will be adjusted by +16%, to equal 2,320,000 Shares (i.e., 2,000,000 Shares * (1+0.16)).  As another example, if the Company achieves Relative TSR at the 65th percentile, then the Target Tranche Shares will be adjusted by +12%, to equal 2,224,000 Shares (i.e., 2,000,000 Shares * (1+0.12)).  The resulting number of Shares as adjusted based on such Relative TSR will become Eligible Shares as of the Certification Date (as defined below) for such Achieved Tranche. 
 
(e)Reported Stock Prices.  For purposes of this Option, any Closing Price or price of the stock of any Index Company that is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other applicable established securities exchange, national market system, or trading platform, referenced in the Agreement for any applicable date or dates will be as reported on The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator deems reliable.
4.Certification of Performance.  The Administrator periodically will determine and certify in writing (a “Certification”) whether the Company has achieved any of the Stock Price Goals, the applicable Stock Price Achievement Date, and the applicable Relative TSR Modifier as of each Stock Price Achievement Date, any adjustments pursuant to the 
-3-
 
Relative TSR Modifier, and any Eligible Shares.  The date of each such certification is a “Certification Date.”  In addition, the Optionee, from time to time (but not more than twice per fiscal quarter of the Company) during the Performance Period, also may make requests that the Administrator complete a Certification.  Upon such written request by the Optionee, the Administrator will complete a Certification within fifteen (15) days of the date of receipt of the Optionee’s written request.  Without limiting the foregoing and to the extent any Tranche is then outstanding and unvested, the Administrator will complete a Certification on or within thirty (30) days following the date of cessation of the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service (but in no event later than the Expiration Date), and additionally, in the case of a Qualifying Termination, the Administrator will complete a final Certification on or within thirty (30) days following the completion of the Adjusted Performance Period (as defined below).  Without limiting the foregoing and to the extent any Tranche is then outstanding and unvested, the Administrator will complete at least one Certification within the thirty (30) day period beginning sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date and further, to the extent reasonably possible that the Company may achieve any Stock Price Goals not yet achieved by such time, in each of the last ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending with the Expiration Date.
5.Continued Eligible Service.  Subject to Sections II.D., II.E, and II.F., upon any Shares subject to a Tranche becoming Eligible Shares on a Certification Date, such Eligible Shares will vest on such Certification Date provided that the Optionee remains in Continued Eligible Service through such Certification Date.  
6.Forfeiture.  Subject to Section II.F., any Shares subject to an Achieved Tranche that have not vested as of the Certification Date applicable to such Tranche will be forfeited immediately and the Optionee no longer will have any rights to vest in or to acquire such Shares under this Option. 
D.Qualifying Termination.  Notwithstanding Sections II.C.1. and II.C.5. above, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, the Performance Period will be adjusted to end on the date nine (9) months following the date of the Qualifying Termination (but in no event later than the Expiration Date) (the “Adjusted Performance Period”).  To the extent that the Company achieves any of the Stock Price Goals with respect to any Tranche that has not yet become an Achieved Tranche during the Adjusted Performance Period, then the Target Tranche Shares subject to such Tranche, as adjusted by the Relative TSR Modifier, will vest as of the applicable Certification Date (notwithstanding cessation of Eligible Continued Service).  
E.Death or Disability.  Notwithstanding Sections II.C.1. and II.C.5. above, in the event of the cessation of the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service due to the Optionee’s death or Disability during the Performance Period, the rules of this Section II.C.E. shall apply.  If such cessation occurs on or before the four (4) year anniversary of the Grant Date, and as of the date of such cessation, (i) the Company achieves an Average Price that is less than a Stock Price Goal applicable to a Tranche that has not yet become an Achieved Tranche, but (ii) the Average Price is greater than the highest Stock Price Goal that is less than the Stock Price Goal described in clause (i), then a number of Shares subject to the Tranche subject to the Stock Price Goal described in clause (i) (the “Incrementally Achieved Goal”) nonetheless will be considered to have achieved the Incrementally Achieved Goal by applying linear interpolation between the Incrementally Achieved Goal and the Stock Price Goal described in clause (ii).  Such resulting number of Shares under such Tranche will be considered the Target Tranche Shares for purposes of applying the Relative TSR Modifier under Section II.C.3, which will be measured by treating the date of cessation of the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service as the Stock Price Achievement Date.  Such number of Shares, as adjusted by the Relative TSR Modifier, will become Eligible Shares under such Tranche and will vest as of the Certification Date.  For purposes of clarity, the remaining Target Tranche Shares subject to such Tranche that were not eligible to become Eligible Shares (determined by disregarding any adjustments made by the Relative TSR Modifier) will remain Target Tranche Shares eligible to become Eligible Shares pursuant to Section II.D. above.  If the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service ceases due to the Optionee’s death or Disability and such cessation occurs after the four (4) year anniversary of the Grant Date but within the Performance Period, then as of the date of such cessation, the Optionee will vest in 100% of the Target Tranche Shares for the lowest numbered Tranche (if any, of Tranches 1 through 8 inclusive) that is not an Achieved Tranche on the date of cessation.  The Optionee will fully vest in those Target Tranche Shares and the Relative TSR Modifier will not be applied to such Shares.  Following application of the preceding sentence to a particular Tranche, no additional shares under that particular Tranche can become Eligible Shares due to subsequent achievement of the Stock Price Goal for that particular Tranche.  In all cases under this Section II.E., (a) any Shares that vested before the date of the Optionee’s cessation of Continued Eligible Service due to death or Disability (for a reason other than application of this Section II.E.) will remain vested and unaffected by this Section II.E., and (b) any Tranches for which the Stock Price Goal had not been achieved as of the date of such cessation, will remain Target Tranche Shares eligible to become Eligible Shares during the Adjusted Performance Period pursuant to Section II.D. above.
-4-
 
1.Example of Linear Interpolation for Death or Disability.  As an example of the linear interpolation described in this Section II.E., if after Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 have become Achieved Tranches, but prior to any other Tranches having become an Achieved Tranche, the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service ceases due to the Optionee’s death or Disability on or prior to the four (4) year anniversary of the Grant Date (but within the Performance Period) and, on the date of such cessation, the Average Price is $130, then 1,000,000 Target Tranche Shares subject to Tranche 3 will be considered to have satisfied the Incrementally Achieved Goal, subject to further adjustment by the Relative TSR Modifier under Section II.C.3, which will be measured by treating the date of cessation of the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service as the Stock Price Achievement Date.  The resulting number of Shares after such adjustment will become Eligible Shares and vest as of the Certification Date.  The remaining 1,000,000 Target Tranche Shares, and Tranches 4 through 8 inclusive, will remain eligible to become Eligible Shares pursuant to Section II.D. above.
2.Example of Death or Disability without Linear Interpolation.  As an example of the effect of the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service ceasing due to the Optionee’s death or Disability within the Performance Period but after the four (4) year anniversary of the Grant Date, assume the following. Before the date of such cessation, Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 became Achieved Tranches and no other Tranche has become an Achieved Tranche.  On the date of such cessation due to the Optionee’s death or Disability, Tranche 3 will fully vest and the Relative TSR Modifier will not be applied to Tranche 3. Tranches 1 and 2 will remain Achieved Tranches. Tranches 4 through 8 inclusive, will remain eligible to become Eligible Shares pursuant to Section II.D. above.
F.Change in Control.  In the event of the first Change in Control to occur following the Grant Date and that occurs during the Performance Period (disregarding the shortening described below), the following terms of this Section II.F. will apply.  
1.Final Certifications.  The Performance Period (including any Adjusted Performance Period) will be shortened to end on a date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, that is estimated to occur within the ten (10) day period prior to the date of completion of the Change in Control (the “Shortened Performance Period”).  Prior to the Change in Control, the Administrator will complete a final Certification for such Shortened Performance Period.  Additionally, the final Certification will include a determination with respect to whether the Company will have achieved, upon the completion of the Change in Control, any Stock Price Goals based on the CIC Price (the “CIC Certification”).
(a)Linear Interpolation for CIC Certification.  If (i) the Company achieves a CIC Price that is less than a Stock Price Goal applicable to a Tranche that has not yet become an Achieved Tranche, but (ii) the CIC Price is greater than the highest Stock Price Goal that is less than the Stock Price Goal described in clause (i), then a number of Shares subject to the Tranche subject to the Stock Price Goal described in clause (i) (the “Partially Achieved Goal”) nonetheless will be considered to have achieved the Partially Achieved Goal by applying linear interpolation between the Partially Achieved Goal and the Stock Price Goal described in clause (ii).  Such resulting number of Shares under such Tranche will be considered the Target Tranche Shares for purposes of applying the Relative TSR Modifier described in Section II.F.2. below.
(b)Linear Interpolation Example.  As an example, assume that a Change in Control occurs both while this Option remains outstanding and the Optionee remains in Continued Eligible Service, the Company achieves a CIC Price of $280.00, and the Company previously achieved the Stock Price Goals for Tranches 1 through 6 but not the Stock Price Goal for Tranche 7 pursuant to the Certifications through and inclusive of the final Certification.  Pursuant to the CIC Certification, the Stock Price Goal for Tranche 7 will be considered a Partially Achieved Goal and 1,000,000 Shares subject to Tranche 7, but subject to further adjustment by the Relative TSR Modifier, as described in Section II.F.2. below, may become Eligible Shares. 
2.CIC Relative TSR Modifier; CIC Vesting.  Any Tranche, that is not yet an Achieved Tranche, for which the Company achieves the applicable Stock Price Goal (or Partially Achieved Goal, as applicable) based on the CIC Price will be adjusted as follows.  The Target Tranche Shares subject to such Tranche will be adjusted in accordance with Section II.C.3. except that TSR for each of the Company and the Index Companies, which will be measured by treating the last day of the Shortened Performance Period as the Stock Price Achievement Date.  Such number of Shares as so adjusted will become Eligible Shares under such Tranche and will vest as of immediately prior to the Change in Control, subject to either the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service through the date of completion of the Change in Control or the Qualifying Termination having occurred no later than nine (9) months prior to the date of completion of the Change in Control.
-5-
 

3.Forfeiture.  Any Shares subject to this Option that have not vested as of immediately prior to the Change in Control will be forfeited as of immediately prior to the Change in Control and will not be eligible for any vesting or payment of any consideration in respect thereof as a result of the completion of the Change in Control.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrator’s authority under Section 5.2 of the Plan to reduce or eliminate the amount payable under an Award does not apply to this Option because this Option is not subject to Article 5 of the Plan.
G.Certain Other Transactions.  In exercising the Administrator’s powers under Section 13.2 of the Plan, the Administrator shall take an action (including refraining from taking action) only if the Administrator in its good faith reasonable judgement, believes that such action will preserve the material economic benefits and rights of this Option (determined without regard to actions otherwise permissible under Section 13.2 of the Plan).  Notwithstanding the preceding, the Administrator, to the extent permitted by Section 13.2 of the Plan, may provide for the termination of the Option after giving the Optionee a reasonable opportunity to exercise all Shares subject to the Option prior to such termination.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of Section 13.2 of the Plan, the Administrator will not require the Optionee to execute a release of claims, nor will the Administrator bar exercise of the Option for a period exceeding five (5) business days (and only after advance written notice to the Optionee of not less than five (5) business days). 


III.

Termination Period
This Option will be exercisable, to the extent vested (or vests pursuant to Section II.D. or II.E. above), for one (1) year after the Optionee’s Continued Eligible Service ceases.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in no event may this Option be exercised after the Expiration Date as provided above and this Option may be subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 13.2 of the Plan.
 


IV.

Clawback.  
The Option and the Shares covered by the Option will be subject only to any specific clawback requirements mandated by applicable statute or listing requirements (and only to the limited extent that the detailed operative terms of the clawback (including, but not limited to, the specific circumstances in which a clawback may be applied) are explicitly mandated by the applicable statute or listing requirement and (a) only if  it is determined, reasonably and in good faith, that the Optionee intentionally and knowingly engaged in gross misconduct that led to material restatement of the Company’s financial statements, and (b) as a result of the restatement, one or more Stock Price Goals were achieved that otherwise would not have been achieved, in which case (c) the Board, in it its discretion, may recover from the Optionee the vested Shares received by the Optionee on account of the Stock Price Goals that would not otherwise have been achieved.  Notwithstanding Section 11.5 of the Plan, no clawback policy may be applied retroactively to this Option or the Shares acquired under this Option. 
 


 

V.

Holding Period.  
In addition to any other restrictions on the transfer of any Shares acquired under this Option, any Shares acquired upon exercise of this Option will not be transferrable, subject to next succeeding sentence, for a period of one (1) year following the date on which such Shares vested (the “Holding Period”), with the exception that Shares may be transferred (including, without limitation, sales of Shares in the public market) during the Holding Period to the extent necessary to satisfy the exercise price of the Option and any applicable tax obligations that may arise in connection with such exercise, and the Optionee will be permitted to transfer any exercised Shares during the Holding Period to the Optionee’s immediate family, estate planning vehicle or in connection with charitable or philanthropic activities undertaken by Optionee (including, but not limited to, gifts to foundations, non-profits or other charitable organizations), provided that such Shares transferred to such transferee will be subject to the transfer restriction set forth in this Section V for the remainder of the Holding Period.  If the Optionee experiences a Qualifying Termination, the Holding Period will be six (6) months rather than one (1) year.  For purposes of this Section V, the Optionee’s “immediate family” will mean any of the Optionee’s child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law. The Optionee shall be permitted to adopt and implement a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to all Shares acquired under this Option, subject to this Section V.

5.4Tax Consultation.  The Optionee understands that the Optionee may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of the grant, vesting and/or exercise of the Option, and/or with the purchase or disposition of the Shares subject to the Option.  The Optionee represents that the Optionee has consulted with any tax consultants the Optionee deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of such shares and that the Optionee is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.
 
5.5Optionee’s Representations.  The Optionee shall, if required by the Company, concurrently with the exercise of all or any portion of this Option, make such written representations as are deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate by the Company and/or the Company’s counsel.

Any action taken under this Section 5.6 or 
-3-
 
Section 13.10 of the Plan shall be intended to preserve for the Optionee the rights and benefits of this Option Agreement (determined without regard to the other provisions of this Section 5.6).
 
5.7Amendment, Suspension and Termination.  No amendment, modification, suspension or termination of this Option Agreement shall adversely affect the Option or Optionee without the prior written consent of the Optionee, and, in no event, shall the Administrator, in exercising its discretion under the Plan or this Option Agreement, undertake or permit any amendment, modification, suspension or termination that, in any manner, adversely affects the Option or Optionee without the prior written consent of the Optionee. Any action described in the preceding sentence that is implemented without the prior written consent of the Optionee shall be presumed to adversely affect the Optionee if the Optionee, in the Optionees’ good faith determination, notifies the Company in writing that Optionee believes such action violates this Section 5.7.  In that case, the Company shall have the affirmative burden to prove to Optionee’s satisfaction (or the satisfaction of a court with jurisdiction) that Optionee’s determination was unreasonable.  Otherwise, that action to which the Optionee objects shall be of no force or effect. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 11.7 and Section 12.5 of the Plan do not apply to this Option Agreement. 
 
5.8Not a Contract of Service Relationship.  Nothing in the Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Optionee any right to continue to serve as an Employee, Director, Consultant or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of the Optionee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Company or a Subsidiary and the Optionee.
 
5.9Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Agreement, if the Optionee is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Plan, the Option and the Agreement shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.
 
5.10Conformity to Securities Laws.  The Optionee acknowledges that the Plan and the Agreement are intended to conform to the extent necessary with all provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any and all regulations and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as well as all applicable state securities laws and regulations.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan shall be administered, and the Option is granted and may be exercised, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and the Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.  The Company, at all times, shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to satisfy all conditions specified in Section 11.4 of the Plan so that the Optionee will be able to receive all rights and benefits of this Option Agreement. The Company at all times shall maintain sufficient Shares under the Plan to meet its obligations under this Option Agreement.
 
5.11Limitation on the Optionee’s Rights.  Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided.  The Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as creating a trust.  The Plan, in and of itself, has no assets.  The Optionee shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Option, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Common Stock as a general unsecured creditor with respect to Options, as and when payable hereunder.
 
5.12No Advice Regarding Grant.  The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Optionee’s participation in the Plan, or the Optionee’s acquisition or sale of the Shares underlying the Option.  The Optionee is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisers regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
 
5.13Successors and Assigns.  Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Article 5, the Agreement shall be binding upon the Optionee and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
 
5.14Entire Agreement.  The Plan and the Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof.  In the event that any provision in the Agreement will be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision 
-4-
 
will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of the Agreement. 
 
5.15Notices.  Any notice to be given under the terms of the Agreement to the Company shall be addressed to the Company in care of the Secretary of the Company at the Company’s principal office, and any notice to be given to the Optionee shall be addressed to the Optionee at the Optionee’s last address reflected on the Company’s records.  Any notice shall be deemed duly given when sent via email or when sent by reputable overnight courier or by certified mail (return receipt requested) through the United States Postal Service.
 
5.16Governing Law.  The laws of the State of Delaware shall govern the interpretation, validity, administration, enforcement and performance of the terms of the Agreement regardless of the law that might be applied under principles of conflicts of laws.
 
5.17Titles.  Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of the Agreement.

PURCHASE
AND SALE

 
 

Closing. On the Closing Date,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
substantially concurrent with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto, the Company agrees to sell, and
the Purchaser agree to purchase, US$750,000 (“Subscription
Amount”) of Common Stock (or 150,000,000
shares) at the Per Share Purchase Price. The Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser the Shares, and the Company and each
Purchaser shall deliver the other items set forth in Section 2.2
deliverable at the Closing. Upon satisfaction of the covenants and
conditions set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the Closing shall
occur at such location as the parties shall mutually agree. Unless
otherwise agreed, settlement of the Shares shall occur either via
wire and DWAC (defined below) or via ""Delivery Versus Payment""
(“DVP”)
(i.e., on the Closing Date, the Company shall issue the Shares
registered in the Purchaser’s name and address and released
by the Transfer Agent pursuant to instructions to the Transfer
Agent provided by the Purchaser, directly to the account(s)
identified by the Purchaser, and payment therefor shall be made by
the Purchaser by wire transfer to the Company). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein and the Purchaser’s
Subscription Amount set forth on the signature pages attached
hereto, the number of Shares purchased by a Purchaser (and its
Affiliates) hereunder shall not, when aggregated with all other
shares of Common Stock owned by such Purchaser (and its Affiliates)

determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) in
excess of 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding Common Stock
outstanding at the Closing (the “Beneficial Ownership
Maximum”), and such Purchaser’s Subscription
Amount, to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Beneficial
Ownership Maximum immediately prior to the Closing, shall be
conditioned upon the issuance of Shares at the Closing to the other
Purchasers signatory hereto. To the extent that a Purchaser’s
beneficial ownership of the Shares would otherwise be deemed to
exceed the Beneficial Ownership Maximum, such Purchasers’
Subscription Amount shall automatically be reduced as necessary in
order to comply with this paragraph.

REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES

 

 

Representations and Warranties of the
Company. The Company hereby makes the following
representations and warranties to the Purchaser as of each Closing
Date:
 
 

(a) Subsidiaries. All of the direct
and indirect Significant Subsidiaries of the Company are set forth
in the SEC Reports. The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all
of the capital stock or other equity interests of each such
Subsidiary free and clear of any Liens, and all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each such Subsidiary are
validly issued and are fully paid, non-assessable (to the extent
such concept applies under relevant law) and free of preemptive and
similar rights to subscribe for or purchase
securities.
 

 
(b) Organization and Qualification.
The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is an entity duly
incorporated or otherwise organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, with the requisite power and authority to own and use
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation
nor default of any of the provisions of its respective certificate
or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or
charter documents. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to conduct business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted or property owned by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, as the case may be, could not have
or reasonably be expected to result in: (i) a material adverse
effect on the legality, validity or enforceability of any
Transaction Document, (ii) a material adverse effect on the results
of operations, assets, business, prospects or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iii) a material adverse effect on the Company’s
ability to perform in any material respect on a timely basis its
obligations under any Transaction Document (any of (i), (ii) or
(iii), a “Material
Adverse Effect”) and no Proceeding has been instituted
in any such jurisdiction revoking, limiting or curtailing or
seeking to revoke, limit or curtail such power and authority or
qualification.
 

 
(c) Authorization; Enforcement. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents and otherwise
to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the other
Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by it of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Company and
no further action is required by the Company, the Board of
Directors or the Company’s stockholders in connection
herewith or therewith other than in connection with the Required
Approvals. Subject to obtaining the Required Approvals, this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a
party has been (or upon delivery will have been) duly executed by
the Company and, when delivered in accordance with the terms hereof
and thereof, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except (i) as limited by general equitable principles and
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally, (ii) as limited by laws relating
to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies and (iii) insofar as indemnification and
contribution provisions may be limited by applicable
law.
 

 
(d) No Conflicts. Except as set
forth in Section 3(d) of the Disclosure Schedules, the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the issuance
and sale of the Shares and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated



 





 


 

hereby
and thereby do not and will not (i) subject to the Required
Approvals, conflict with or violate any provision of the
Company’s or any Subsidiary’s Certificate or Articles
of Incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter
documents, or (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) of,
any agreement, credit facility, debt or other instrument
(evidencing a Company or Subsidiary debt or otherwise) or other
understanding to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is
bound or affected, or

(iii)
subject to the Required Approvals, conflict with or result in a
violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
injunction, decree or other restriction of any court or
governmental authority to which the Company or a Subsidiary is
subject (including federal and state securities laws and
regulations), or by which any property or asset of the Company or a
Subsidiary is bound or affected; except in the case of each of
clauses (ii) and (iii), such as could not have or reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 

 
(e) Filings, Consents and
Approvals. The Company is not required to obtain any
consent, waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice to, or
make any filing or registration with, any court or other federal,
state, local or other governmental authority or other Person in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of the Transaction Documents, other than: (i) the filings
required pursuant to Section

3.5 of
this Agreement, blue sky filings or a Form D filing or (ii)
application to any applicable Trading Market for the listing of the
Shares, following registration of such shares under the Securities
Act, for trading thereon in the time and manner required thereby
(the “Required
Approvals”).

 

 
(f) Issuance of the Shares;
Registration. The Shares are duly authorized and, when
issued and paid for in accordance with the applicable Transaction
Documents, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens imposed by the Company.
The Company has reserved from its duly authorized capital stock the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company has prepared and filed the Registration
Statement in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act, which became effective on April 15, 2021 (the
“Effective
Date”), including the Prospectus, and such amendments
and supplements thereto as may have been required to the date of
this Agreement. The Registration Statement is effective under the
Securities Act and no stop order preventing or suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or suspending or
preventing the use of the Prospectus has been issued by the
Commission and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted
or, to the knowledge of the Company, are threatened by the
Commission. The Company, if required by the rules and regulations
of the Commission, shall file the Prospectus with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b). At the time the Registration Statement and
any amendments thereto became effective, at the date of this
Agreement and at the Closing Date, the Registration Statement and
any amendments thereto conformed and will conform in all material
respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and did not and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading; and the Prospectus
and any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time the
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto was issued and at
the Closing Date, conformed and will conform in all material
respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and did not and
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Company was at the time of the filing of
the Registration Statement eligible to use Form S-3 and the
issuance of the Shares will be free from any transfer restrictions
including any fixed price sales requirements. The Company is
eligible to use Form S-3 under the Securities Act and it meets the
transaction requirements with as set forth in General Instruction
I.B.1 of Form S-3.1
 

 
(g) Capitalization. The
capitalization of the Company is as set forth on Schedule 3.1(g). Except as set
forth in such schedule, the Company has not issued any capital
stock since its most recently filed periodic report under the
Exchange Act, other than pursuant to the exercise of employee stock
awards under the Company’s equity incentive plans, the
issuance of shares of Common Stock to employees pursuant to the
Company’s employee stock purchase plans and pursuant to the
conversion and/or exercise of Common Stock Equivalents outstanding
as of the date of the most recently filed periodic report under the
Exchange Act. No Person has any right of first refusal, preemptive
right, right of participation, or any similar right to participate
in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(g) and
Schedule
3.1(r), as a result
of the purchase and sale of the Shares, there are no outstanding
options, warrants, scrip rights to subscribe to, calls or
commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities,
rights or obligations convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for, or giving any Person any right to subscribe for
or acquire, any

Company to provide calculations evidencing the $75M
float.



 





 


 

shares
of Common Stock or the capital stock of any Subsidiary, or
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the
Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to issue
additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or
capital stock of any Subsidiary. The issuance and sale of the
Shares will not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to issue
shares of Common Stock or other securities to any Person (other
than the Purchaser) and will not result in a right of any holder of
Company securities to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange or
reset price under any of such securities. There are no outstanding
securities or instruments of the Company or any Subsidiary with any
provision that adjusts the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset
price of such security or instrument upon an issuance of securities
by the Company or any Subsidiary. There are no outstanding
securities or instruments of the Company or any Subsidiary that
contain any redemption or similar provisions, and there are no
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the
Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to redeem a
security of the Company or such Subsidiary. The Company does not
have any stock appreciation rights or “phantom stock”
plans or agreements or any similar plan or agreement. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, have been
issued in compliance with all federal and state securities laws,
and none of such outstanding shares was issued in violation of any
preemptive rights or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase
securities. No further approval or authorization of any
stockholder, the Board of Directors or others is required for the
issuance and sale of the Shares. There are no stockholders
agreements, voting agreements or other similar agreements with
respect to the Company’s capital stock to which the Company
is a party or, to the knowledge of the Company, between or among
any of the Company’s stockholders.
 

 
(h) SEC Reports; Financial
Statements. The Company has filed all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by the
Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) thereof, for the two years
preceding the date hereof (or such shorter period as the Company
was required by law or regulation to file such material) (the
foregoing materials, including the exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, being collectively referred to
herein as the “SEC
Reports”) on a timely basis or has received a valid
extension or waiver of such time of filing and has filed any such
SEC Reports prior to the expiration of any such extension. As of
their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of the SEC Reports, when
filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company has never been an issuer subject to Rule 144(i) under the
Securities Act. The financial statements of the Company included in
the SEC Reports comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the
Commission with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing.
Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (“GAAP”), , except as may
be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes
thereto and except that unaudited financial statements may not
contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and the
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended,
subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal,
immaterial, year-end audit adjustments. The financial data set
forth in each of the SEC Reports fairly presents the information
set forth therein on a basis consistent with that of the audited
financial statements contained in the Company’s SEC
Reports.
 

 
(i) Material Changes; Undisclosed Events,
Liabilities or Developments. Since the date of the latest
financial statements included within the SEC Reports (i) there has
been no event, occurrence or development that has had or that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
the Company has not incurred any liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) other than (A) trade payables and accrued expenses
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (B) liabilities not required to be reflected in the
Company’s financial statements pursuant to GAAP or disclosed
in filings made with the Commission, (iii) the Company has not

or made any dividend or distribution of cash or other property to
its stockholders or purchased, redeemed or made any agreements to

Company has not issued any equity securities to any officer,

incentive plans. The Company does not have pending before the
Commission any request for confidential treatment of information.
Other than as disclosed on other schedules to this Agreement and
except for the issuance of the Shares contemplated by this
Agreement, no event, liability, fact, circumstance, occurrence or
development has occurred or exists or is reasonably expected to
occur or exist with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, prospects, properties, operations,
assets or financial condition that would be required to be
disclosed by the Company under applicable securities laws at the
time this representation is made or deemed



 





 


 

made
that has not been publicly disclosed at least one Trading Day prior
to the date that this representation is made.

 

 
(j) Litigation. Except as disclosed
in the SEC Reports and/or Section 3(j) of the Disclosure Schedules,
there is no action, suit, inquiry, notice of violation, proceeding
or investigation, inquiry or other similar proceeding of any
federal or state government unit pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company, any
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties before or by any
court, arbitrator, governmental or administrative agency or
regulatory authority (federal, state, county, local or foreign)
(collectively, an “Action”) which (i)
adversely affects or challenges the legality, validity or
enforceability of any of the Transaction Documents or the issuance
of the Shares or (ii) could, if there were an unfavorable decision,
have or reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has no reason to believe that an Action will be
filed against it in the future. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary, nor any director or officer thereof, is or has been the
subject of any Action involving a claim of violation of or
liability under federal or state securities laws or a claim for
fraud or breach of fiduciary duty. There has not been, and to the
knowledge of the Company, there is not pending or contemplated, any
investigation or inquiry by the Commission involving the Company or
any current or former director or officer of the
Company.

 
(k) Labor Relations. No labor
dispute exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent

member of a union that relates to such employee’s
relationship with the Company or such Subsidiary, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to a collective
bargaining agreement, and the Company and its Subsidiaries believe
that their relationships with their employees are good. To the
knowledge of the Company, no effort is underway to unionize or
organize the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary. To the
knowledge of the Company, no executive officer of the Company or
any Subsidiary, is, or is now expected to be, in violation of any
material term of any employment contract, confidentiality,
disclosure or proprietary information agreement or non-competition
agreement, or any other contract or agreement or any restrictive
covenant in favor of any third party, and the continued employment
of each such executive officer does not subject the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to any liability with respect to any of the
foregoing matters. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations relating to employment and employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where the
failure to be in compliance could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. There is no workmen’s compensation liability matter,
employment-related charge, complaint, grievance, investigation,
inquiry or obligation of any kind pending, or to the
Company’s knowledge, threatened, relating to an alleged
violation or breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any law,
regulation or contract that could, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 
(l) Compliance. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary: (i) is in default under or in violation of (and
no event has occurred that has not been waived that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would result in a default by the Company or
any Subsidiary under), nor has the Company or any Subsidiary
received notice of a claim that it is in default under or that it
is in violation of, any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any
other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it
or any of its properties is bound (whether or not such default or
violation has been waived), (ii) is in violation of any judgment,
decree or order of any court, arbitrator or other governmental
authority or (iii) is or has been in violation of any statute,
rule, ordinance or regulation of any governmental authority,

labor matters, except in each case as could not have or reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

local and foreign laws relating to pollution or protection of human
health or the environment (including ambient air, surface water,
groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata), including laws
relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases
of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, or toxic or hazardous
substances or wastes (collectively, “Hazardous Materials”)
into the environment, or otherwise relating to the manufacture,
processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport or handling of Hazardous Materials, as well as all

Material Adverse Effect.

 
(n) Regulatory Permits. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries possess all certificates,
authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate regulatory
authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses,
except where the failure to possess such certificates,
authorizations or permits would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to
the revocation or modification of any such certificate,
authorization or permit. There is no agreement, commitment,
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party which has or would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any
business practice of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
acquisition of property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the conduct of business by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted other than such effects,
individually or in the aggregate, which have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 
 
(o) Title to Assets. Subject to the
Liens, the Company and the Subsidiaries have good and marketable
title in fee simple to all personal property owned by them that is
material to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries. The

  To the Company’s
knowledge, the Intellectual Property does not interfere with,
infringe upon, misappropriate, or otherwise come into conflict
with, any Intellectual Property rights of third parties, and the
Company has no knowledge that facts exist which indicate a
likelihood of the foregoing. The Company has not received any
charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging any such
interference, infringement, misappropriation, or conflict
(including any claim that the Company must license or refrain from
using any Intellectual Property rights of any third party). To the
knowledge of the Company, no third party has interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise come into conflict
with, any Intellectual Property rights of the Company.

enforceable, and in full force and effect;
 

 
(B) To the
Company’s knowledge, no party to the Licensed Intellectual

Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and the Company has
taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to

taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable
any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill
(including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other
similar anti-takeover provision under the Company’s
certificate of incorporation (or similar charter documents) or the
laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become
applicable to the Purchaser as a result of the Purchaser and the
Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights
under the Transaction Documents, including without limitation as a
result of the Company’s issuance of the Shares and the
Purchaser’s ownership of the Shares.
 
 

(y) Disclosure. Except with respect
to the material terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Company confirms
that neither it nor any other Person acting on its behalf has
provided the Purchaser or its agent or counsel with any information
that it believes constitutes or might constitute material,
non-public information which has not otherwise been disclosed. The
Company understands and confirms that the Purchaser will rely on
the foregoing representation in effecting transactions in
securities of the Company. All of the disclosure furnished by or on
behalf of the Company to the Purchaser regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Disclosure Schedules to this
Agreement, is true and correct and does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made not misleading. The
press releases disseminated by the Company during the 12 months
preceding the date of this Agreement do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made and when made, not misleading. The Company acknowledges
and agrees that the Purchaser has not made or makes any
representations or warranties with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth in this
Agreement.

 
(z) No Integrated Offering.
Assuming the accuracy of the Purchaser’s representations and
warranties, neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
Person acting on its or their behalf has, directly or indirectly,
made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to
buy any security, under circumstances that would cause this
offering of the Shares to be integrated with prior offerings by the
Company for purposes of any applicable stockholder approval
provisions of any Trading Market on which any of the securities of
the Company are listed or designated.
 

 

(aa)
Solvency. Based on
the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of the
Closing Date, after giving effect to the receipt by the Company of
the proceeds from the sale of the Shares hereunder, (i) the
Company’s assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital
to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted including its capital needs taking into account the
particular capital requirements of the business conducted by the
Company, consolidated and projected capital requirements and
capital availability thereof, and (ii) the current cash flow of the
Company, together with the proceeds the Company would receive, were
it to liquidate all of its assets, after taking into account all
anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all
amounts on or in respect of its liabilities when such amounts are
required to be paid. The Company does not intend to incur debts
beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into
account



 





 


 

the
timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its
debt). The Company has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances
which lead it to believe that it will file for reorganization or
liquidation under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of any
jurisdiction within one year from the Closing Date. Schedule 3.1(aa) sets forth as
of the date hereof all outstanding secured and unsecured
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary, or for which the
Company or any Subsidiary has commitments. For the purposes of this
Agreement, “Indebtedness” means (x) any liabilities for
borrowed money or amounts owed in excess of $50,000 (other than
trade accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of
business), (y) all guaranties, endorsements and other contingent
obligations in respect of indebtedness of others, whether or not
the same are or should be reflected in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto), except
guaranties by endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or
collection or similar transactions in the ordinary course of
business; and (z) the present value of any lease payments in excess
of $50,000 due under leases required to be capitalized in
accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
default with respect to any Indebtedness.

 

(bb)
Tax Status. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all federal, state,
local and foreign tax returns which have been required to be filed
and paid all taxes shown thereon through the date hereof, to the
extent that such taxes have become due and are not being contested
in good faith, except where the failure to so file or pay would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. No tax deficiency has been
determined adversely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which has had, or would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has no knowledge of any
federal, state or other governmental tax deficiency, penalty or
assessment which has been or might be asserted or threatened
against it which would have a Material Adverse Effect
 
 


(cc)
Foreign Corrupt
Practices. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor to
the knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary, any agent or other
person acting on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary, has (i)
directly or indirectly, used any funds for unlawful contributions,
gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to foreign
or domestic political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to
foreign or domestic government officials or employees or to any
foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns from corporate
funds, (iii) failed to disclose fully any contribution made by the
Company or any Subsidiary (or made by any person acting on its
behalf of which the Company is aware) which is in violation of law,
or (iv) violated any provision of FCPA.
 

 

(dd)
Accountants. The
Company’s accounting firm is set forth in the SEC Reports. To
the knowledge and belief of the Company, such accounting firm (i)
is a registered public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board as required by the Exchange Act
and (ii) will express its opinion with respect to the financial
statements included in the Company’s Annual Report for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.

acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser is acting solely in the
capacity of an arm’s length purchaser with respect to the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby.
The Company further acknowledges that the Purchaser is not acting
as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in any
similar capacity) with respect to the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated thereby and any advice given by the
Purchaser or any of their respective representatives or agents in
connection with the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby is merely incidental to the Purchaser’s
purchase of the Shares. The Company further represents to the
Purchaser that the Company’s decision to enter into this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents has been based solely

hereby by the Company and its representatives.

Company that: (i) the Purchaser has not been asked by the Company
to agree, nor has the Purchaser agreed, to desist from purchasing
or selling, long and/or short, securities of the Company, or
“derivative” securities based on securities issued by
the Company or to hold the Shares for any specified term; (ii) past
or future open market or other transactions by the Purchaser,
specifically including, without limitation, Short Sales or
“derivative” transactions, before or after the closing
of this or future private placement transactions, may negatively
impact the market price of the Company’s publicly-traded
securities; (iii) the Purchaser, and counter-parties in
“derivative” transactions to which the Purchaser is a
party, directly or indirectly, presently may have a
“short” position in the Common Stock, and (iv) the
Purchaser shall not be deemed to have any affiliation with or
control over any arm’s length counter-party in any
“derivative” transaction. The Company further
understands and acknowledges that (y) the Purchaser may engage in
hedging activities at various



 





 


 

times
during the period that the Shares are outstanding, including,
without limitation, during the periods that the value of the Shares
deliverable with respect to Shares are being determined, and (z)
such hedging activities (if any) could reduce the value of the
existing stockholders’ equity interests in the Company at and
after the time that the hedging activities are being conducted. The
Company acknowledges that such aforementioned hedging activities do
not constitute a breach of any of the Transaction
Documents.
 

 

(gg)
Regulation M
Compliance. The Company has not, and to its knowledge no one
acting on its behalf has, (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any
action designed to cause or to result in the stabilization or

of, any of the Shares, or (iii) paid or agreed to pay to any Person
any compensation for soliciting another to purchase any other

Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby represents and warrants as
of the date hereof and as of the applicable Closing Date to the

therein):

 
 
(a) Organization; Authority. The
Purchaser is either an individual or an entity duly incorporated or
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation with full right,
corporate, partnership, limited liability company or similar power
and authority to enter into and to consummate the transactions

obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and performance by the Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all

similar action, as applicable, on the part of the Purchaser. Each
Transaction Document to which it is a party has been duly executed
by the Purchaser, and when delivered by the Purchaser in accordance
with the terms hereof, will constitute the valid and legally

equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application

(b) Understandings or Arrangements.
The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares as principal for its own
account and has no direct or indirect arrangement or understandings
with any other persons to distribute or regarding the distribution
of such Shares (this representation and warranty not limiting the
Purchaser’s right to sell the Shares in compliance with
applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws). The Purchaser
is acquiring such Shares as principal for his, her or its own
account and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling
such Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act
or any applicable state securities law, has no present intention of
distributing any of such Shares in violation of the Securities Act
or any applicable state securities law and has no direct or
indirect arrangement or understandings with any other persons to
distribute or regarding the distribution of such Shares in
violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law (this representation and warranty not limiting the
Purchaser’s right to sell such Shares pursuant to a
registration statement or otherwise in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities laws).
 

 
(c) Purchaser Status. At the time
the Purchaser was offered the Shares, it was, and as of the date
hereof it is, outside the United States or an institutional
accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3)
or (7) under the Securities Act.
 

 
(d) Experience of the Purchaser.
The Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives,
has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and
financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the prospective investment in the Shares, and has so
evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. The Purchaser
can bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares and, at
the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such
investment.
 

 
(e) Access to Information. The
Purchaser acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to review
the Transaction Documents (including all exhibits and schedules
thereto) and of the SEC Reports.
 

 
(f) Certain Transactions and

contemplated hereunder, the Purchaser has not, nor has any Person
acting on behalf of or pursuant to any understanding with the
Purchaser, directly or indirectly executed any purchases or sales,
including Short Sales, of the securities of the Company during the
period commencing as of the time that the Purchaser first received
a term sheet (written or oral) from the Company or any other Person
representing the Company setting forth the material terms of the
transactions contemplated hereunder and ending immediately prior to
the execution hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby
separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of the
Purchaser’s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct
knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio
managers managing other portions of the Purchaser’s assets,
the representation set forth above shall only apply with respect to
the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made
the investment decision to purchase the Shares covered by this
Agreement. Other than to other Persons party to this Agreement or
to the Purchaser’s representatives, including, without
limitation, its officers, directors, partners, legal and other
advisors, employees, agents and Affiliates, the Purchaser has
maintained the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in
connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms
of this transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for avoidance
of doubt, nothing contained herein shall constitute a
representation or warranty, or preclude any actions, with respect
to the identification of the availability of, or securing of,
available shares to borrow in order to effect Short Sales or
similar transactions in the future.
 

 

The
Company acknowledges and agrees that the representations contained
in this Agreement shall not modify, amend or affect the
Purchaser’s right to rely on the Company’s
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any
representations and warranties contained in any other Transaction
Document or any other document or instrument executed and/or
delivered in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of
the transaction contemplated hereby.

Company fails to make Public Information Failure payments in a
timely manner, such Public Information Failure payments shall bear
interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month
(prorated for partial months) until paid in full. Nothing herein
shall limit the Purchaser’s right to pursue actual damages

the right to pursue all remedies available to it at law or in
equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief.

terminate. The Company and the Purchaser shall consult with each
other in issuing any press releases with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the Company nor the
Purchaser shall issue any such press release nor otherwise make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the Company,
with respect to any press release of the Purchaser, or without the
prior consent of the Purchaser, with respect to any press release
of the Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed, except if such disclosure is required by law, in which
case the disclosing party shall promptly provide the other party

a rights agreement) or similar anti-takeover plan or arrangement in
effect or hereafter adopted by the Company, or that the Purchaser
could be deemed to trigger the provisions of any such plan or
arrangement, by virtue of receiving Shares under the Transaction
Documents or under any other agreement between the Company and the
Purchaser.

the
Company reasonably believes constitutes, material non-public
information, unless prior thereto the Purchaser shall have
consented to the receipt of such information and agreed with the
Company to keep such information confidential. Prior to providing
the Purchaser with any material non-public information, the Company
shall provide the Purchaser with a consent substantially in the
form attached as Exhibit

covenants and agrees that the Purchaser shall not have any duty of
confidentiality to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective officers, directors, agents, employees or

contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or
any Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice
or other material information with the Commission pursuant to a
Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company understands and confirms
that the Purchaser shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in
effecting transactions in securities of the Company. In addition to
any other remedies provided by this Agreement or other Transaction
Documents, if the Company knowingly provides any material,
non-public information to the Purchaser without its prior written
consent, and it fails to immediately (no later than that Trading
Day) file a Form 8-K disclosing this material, non-public
information, it shall pay the Purchaser as partial liquidated
damages and not as a penalty $5,000 per day beginning with the day
the information is disclosed to the Purchaser and ending and
including the day the Form 8-K disclosing this information is
filed. By 9:00 am New York, NY time on the Trading Day following
the Closing Date, the Company shall file a Current Report on Form
8-K disclosing the purchase of the Shares.

 

 

Use of Proceeds. The Company
shall use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares hereunder to
pay the initial application fee and annual fee for the OTCQB and
the remainder for working capital purposes, and shall not use such
proceeds: (a) for the satisfaction of any Indebtedness as in the
Transaction Documents, (b) for the redemption of any Common Stock
or Common Stock Equivalents, (c) in violation of FCPA or OFAC
regulations, or (d) to lend money, give credit, or make advances to
any officers, directors, employees or affiliates of the
Company.

 

 

Indemnification of Purchaser.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the Company will
indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, members, partners, employees and agents (and any
other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person
holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any
other title), each Person who controls the Purchaser (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the
Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, stockholders, agents,
members, partners or employees (and any other Persons with a
functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles
notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such
controlling persons (each, a “Purchaser Party”) harmless from any
and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies,
damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid
in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs of investigation (including local counsel, if retained)
that any the Purchaser Party may suffer or incur as a result of or
relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in this
Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents, (b) any action
instituted against the Purchaser Parties in any capacity, or any of
them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the
Company who is not an Affiliate of the Purchaser Party, with
respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents (unless such action is solely based upon a breach of the
Purchaser Party’s representations, warranties or covenants
under the Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings
the Purchaser Party may have with any such stockholder or any
violations by the Purchaser Party of state or federal securities
laws or any conduct by the Purchaser Party which constitutes fraud,
gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance) or (c) any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any registration statement, any prospectus or any form of
prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the
case of any prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. If any
action shall be brought against the Purchaser Party in respect of
which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, the
Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and
the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with
counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
Party. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
of the Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i)
the

employment thereof
has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii)
the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume
such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there
is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on
any material issue between the position of the Company and the
position of the Purchaser Party, in which case the Company shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than
one such separate counsel (in addition to local counsel, if
retained). The Company will not be liable to the Purchaser Party
under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a Purchaser Party
effected without the Company’s prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the
extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or
liability is attributable to the Purchaser Party’s breach of
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
made by the Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in the other
Transaction Documents. The Purchaser Parties shall have the right
to settle any action against any of them by the payment of money
provided that they cannot agree to any equitable relief and the
Company, its officers, directors and Affiliates receive
unconditional releases in customary form. The indemnification
required by this Section 4.7 shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount thereof during the investigation or defense, as and when
bills are received or are incurred. The indemnity agreements
contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or
similar right of the Purchaser Party against the Company or others
and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to
law.

 

 

Listing or quotation of Common
Stock. The Company hereby agrees to use best efforts to
maintain the listing or quotation of the Common Stock on the
Trading Market on which it is currently listed or quoted. The
Company further agrees, if the Company applies to have the Common
Stock traded on any other Trading Market, it will then include in
such application all of the Shares, and will take such other action
as is necessary to cause all of the Shares to be listed or quoted
on such other Trading Market as promptly as possible. The Company
will then take all action necessary to continue the listing or
quotation and trading of its Common Stock on a Trading Market and
will comply in all respects with the Company’s reporting,
filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the
Trading Market. The Company agrees to maintain the eligibility of
the Common Stock for electronic transfer through the Depository
Trust Company or another established clearing corporation,
including, without limitation, by timely payment of fees to the
Depository Trust Company or such other established clearing
corporation in connection with such electronic
transfer.

 

 

Equal Treatment of Purchasers.
No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction
Document) shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or
consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of the
Transaction Documents unless the same consideration is also offered
to all of the parties to such Transaction Document. For
clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate right
granted to each Purchaser by the Company and negotiated separately
by each Purchaser, and is intended for the Company to treat the
Purchasers as a class and shall not in any way be construed as the
Purchasers acting in concert or as a group with respect to the
purchase, disposition or voting of Shares or
otherwise.

 

 

Certain Transactions and
Confidentiality. The Purchaser covenants that neither it nor
any Affiliate acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding
with it will execute any purchases or sales, including Short Sales
of any of the Company’s securities during the period
commencing with the execution of this Agreement and ending at such
time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first
publicly announced pursuant to the press release as described in
Section 4.3 (the “Press Release”). The
Purchaser covenants that until such time as the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are publicly disclosed by the
Company pursuant to the Press Release, the Purchaser will maintain
the confidentiality of the existence and terms of this transaction
and the information included in the Disclosure Schedules.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company expressly
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Purchaser does not make any
representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage
in effecting transactions in any securities of the Company after
the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
first publicly announced pursuant to the Press Release, (ii) the
Purchaser shall not be restricted or prohibited from effecting any
transactions in any securities of the Company in accordance with
applicable securities laws from and after the time that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly
announced pursuant to the Press Release and (iii) the Purchaser
shall not have any duty of confidentiality or duty not to trade in
the securities of the Company to the Company or its Subsidiaries
after the issuance of the initial Press Release. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser, if applicable, that is a
multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio
managers manage separate portions of the Purchaser’s assets
and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the
investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other
portions of the Purchaser’s assets, the covenant set forth
above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets
managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision
to purchase the Shares covered by this Agreement.

restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter

exercises a right,
election, demand or option under a Transaction Document and the
Company does not timely perform its related obligations within the
periods therein provided, then that Purchaser may rescind or
withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written
notice to the Company, any relevant notice, demand or election in
whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and
rights.

Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall
issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and

only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of such loss, theft or destruction without requiring the
posting of any bond.

 

 

Remedies. In addition to being
entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law,
including recovery of damages, the Purchaser and the Company will
be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction
Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be
adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach
of obligations contained in the Transaction Documents and hereby
agree to waive and not to assert in any Action for specific
performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate.
 
 


Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays,

action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein
shall not be a Trading Day, then such action may be taken or such
right may be exercised on the next succeeding Trading

Construction. The parties agree
that each of them and/or their respective counsel have reviewed and
had an opportunity to revise the Transaction Documents and,
therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not
be employed in the interpretation of the Transaction Documents or
any amendments thereto. In addition, each and every reference to
share prices and shares of Common Stock in any Transaction Document
shall be subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock
splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar
transactions of the Common Stock that occur after the date of this
Agreement.

action, suit, or proceeding in any jurisdiction brought by any
party against any other party, the parties each knowingly and
intentionally, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law,

all of the provision of this Agreement and take all action as may
be required to protect the rights of all holders of the
Shares.
 
 


Liquidated Damages. The
Company’s obligations to pay any partial liquidated damages
or other amounts owing under the Transaction Documents is a
continuing obligation of the Company and shall not terminate until
all unpaid partial liquidated damages and other amounts have been
paid notwithstanding the fact that the instrument or security
pursuant to which such partial liquidated damages or other amounts

Assignment and Assumption has the meaning set forth in Section 11.06(c). 
Available Tenor means, as of any date of determination and with respect to the then-current Benchmark, as applicable, any
tenor for such Benchmark (or component thereof) or payment period for interest calculated with reference to such Benchmark (or component thereof), as applicable, that is or may be used for determining the length of an Interest Period for any term
rate or otherwise for determining any frequency of making payments of interest calculated pursuant to this Agreement as of such date and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any tenor for such Benchmark that is then-removed from the definition
of Interest Period pursuant to clause (f) of Section 8.01.  Bail-In
Action means the exercise of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority in respect of any liability of an Affected Financial Institution.

Bankruptcy Event means, with respect to any Person, such Person becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding, or has had a receiver, conservator, trustee, administrator, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar Person charged with the reorganization or liquidation of its business appointed for it, or, in the good faith
determination of the Administrative Agent, has taken any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any such proceeding or appointment, provided that a Bankruptcy Event shall not result solely by
virtue of any ownership interest, or the acquisition of any ownership interest, in such Person by a Governmental Authority or instrumentality thereof, provided, further, that such ownership interest does not result in or provide such
Person with immunity from the jurisdiction of courts within the United States or from the enforcement of judgments or writs of attachment on its assets or permit such Person (or such Governmental Authority or instrumentality) to reject, repudiate,
disavow or disaffirm any contracts or agreements made by such Person. 
   2 






 Base Rate means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the highest of
(a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the NYFRB Rate in effect on such day plus 1⁄2 of 1% and (c) the Euro-Dollar Rate for a one month
Interest Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1%; provided that, for the purpose of this definition, the Euro-Dollar Rate for any day shall be based on the Euro-Dollar
Screen Rate (or, if the Euro-Dollar Screen Rate is not available for such one month Interest Period, the Interpolated Rate) at approximately 11:00 A.M. London time on such day. If the Base Rate is being used as an alternate rate of interest pursuant
to Section 8.01 (for the avoidance of doubt, only until the Benchmark Replacement has been determined pursuant to Section 8.01(b)), then the Base Rate shall be the greater of clauses (a) and (b) above and shall be determined without
reference to clause (c) above. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Base Rate as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less than 1.00%, such rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%. 
Base Rate Loan means (i) a Loan which bears interest at the Base Rate pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing

Benchmark means, initially, Euro-Dollar Rate; provided that if a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event,
an Early Opt-in Election or an Other Benchmark Rate Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to Euro-Dollar Rate or the then-current Benchmark, then
Benchmark means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to clause (b) or clause (c) of Section 8.01. 
Benchmark Replacement means, for any Available Tenor, the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be
determined by the Administrative Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date; provided that, in the case of an Other Benchmark Rate Election, Benchmark Replacement shall mean the alternative set forth in (3) below: 
(1) the sum of: (a) Term SOFR and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment; 
(2) the sum of: (a) Daily Simple SOFR and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment; 
(3) the sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company as the replacement for
the then-current Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or
(ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then-current Benchmark for dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities at such time and (b) the related Benchmark
Replacement Adjustment; 
   3 






 provided that, in the case of clause (1), such Unadjusted Benchmark
Replacement is displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided further that, in the case of clause (3), when such clause is
used to determine the Benchmark Replacement in connection with the occurrence of an Other Benchmark Rate Election, the alternate benchmark rate selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company shall be the term benchmark rate that is used in
lieu of a LIBOR-based rate in the relevant other Dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities; provided further that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a
Term SOFR Transition Event, and the delivery of a Term SOFR Notice, on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date the Benchmark Replacement shall revert to and shall be deemed to be the sum of (a) Term SOFR and (b) the
related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, as set forth in clause (1) of this definition (subject to the first proviso above).  If the
Benchmark Replacement as determined pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3) above would be less than the Floor, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
Benchmark Replacement Adjustment means, with respect to any replacement of the then-current Benchmark with an Unadjusted
Benchmark Replacement for any applicable Interest Period and Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement:  (1)
for purposes of clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement, the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be determined by the Administrative Agent: 
(a) the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero)
as of the Reference Time such Benchmark Replacement is first set for such Interest Period that has been selected or recommended by the Relevant Governmental Body for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark
Replacement for the applicable Corresponding Tenor;  (b) the spread adjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) as of
the Reference Time such Benchmark Replacement is first set for such Interest Period that would apply to the fallback rate for a derivative transaction referencing the ISDA Definitions to be effective upon an index cessation event with respect to
such Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor; and  (2) for purposes of clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark
Replacement, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company for the applicable
Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted
Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date and/or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment,

   4 






 
or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for dollar-denominated syndicated
credit facilities;  provided that, in the case of clause (1) above, such adjustment is displayed on a screen or other
information service that publishes such Benchmark Replacement Adjustment from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. 
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes means, with respect to any Benchmark Replacement, any technical, administrative or
operational changes (including changes to the definition of Base Rate, the definition of Business Day, the definition of Interest Period, timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest,
timing of borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices, length of lookback periods, the applicability of breakage provisions, and other technical, administrative or operational matters) that the Administrative Agent decides
in its reasonable discretion may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice
(or, if the Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the administration of such Benchmark Replacement
exists, in such other manner of administration as the Administrative Agent decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents). 
Benchmark Replacement Date means the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to the
then-current Benchmark:  (1) in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark Transition Event, the later
of (a) the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely
ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);  (2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition
of Benchmark Transition Event, the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or
such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided, that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication of information referenced in such
clause (3) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date;  (3)
in the case of a Term SOFR Transition Event, the date that is thirty (30) days after the date a Term SOFR Notice is provided to the Lenders and the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(c); or 
   5 






 (4) in the case of an Early Opt-in Election or an
Other Benchmark Rate Election, the sixth (6th) Business Day after the date notice of such Early Opt-in Election or Other Benchmark Rate Election as applicable is provided to the Lenders, so long as the
Administrative Agent has not received, by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Early Opt-in Election or Other Benchmark Rate Election, as applicable, is
provided to the Lenders, written notice of objection to such Early Opt-in Election or Other Benchmark Rate Election, as applicable from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 
For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than,
the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have
occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used
in the calculation thereof).  Benchmark Transition Event means the occurrence of one or more of the following events
with respect to the then-current Benchmark:  (1) a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of
such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely,
provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); 
(2) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published
component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the NYFRB, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution authority with jurisdiction over the administrator
for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component)
has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue
to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or  (3) a public statement or publication of information by
the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) are no longer, or as of a specified
future date will no longer be, representative.  For the avoidance of doubt, a Benchmark Transition Event will be deemed to
have occurred with respect to any Benchmark if a public statement or publication of information set 
   6 






 
forth above has occurred with respect to each then-current Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof). 
Benchmark Unavailability Period means the period (if any) (x) beginning at the time that a Benchmark Replacement Date
pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) of that definition has occurred if, at such time, no Benchmark Replacement has replaced the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in accordance with Section 8.01
and (y) ending at the time that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in accordance with Section 8.01.

Beneficial Ownership Regulation.  Beneficial Ownership Regulation means 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230.

subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) a plan as defined in Section 4975 of the Code to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, and (c) any Person whose assets include (for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations or
otherwise for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) the assets of any such employee benefit plan or plan. 
BHC Act Affiliate of a party means an affiliate (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance
with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.  Board of Directors means the board of directors of the Company. 
Borrower means the Company or any Eligible Subsidiary, as the context may require, and their respective successors, and
Borrowers means all of the foregoing. As of the Effective Date, the only Borrower is the Company. 
Borrowing has the meaning set forth in Section 1.03. 
Business Day means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are

interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter
related to LIBOR or other rates in the definition of Euro-Dollar Rate or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or
replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or (c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event, an Early Opt-in Election or an Other Benchmark
Rate Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 8.01(d)), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or
replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the Euro-Dollar Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the euro interbank offered rate, as
applicable) prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including
any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the applicable Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any
benchmark rate, or any 
   30 






 
component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Company, any Borrower, any Lender or any
other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error
or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.  SECTION 1.05.
Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any Division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdictions laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person
becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall
be deemed to have been organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time. 
SECTION 1.06. Letter of Credit Amounts. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Letter of Credit available to be drawn at such time; provided that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Letter of Credit Agreement related thereto, provides for one or
more automatic increases in the available amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum amount is
available to be drawn at such time.  ARTICLE 2 
THE FACILITY 
SECTION 2.01. Commitments to Lend. (a) During the Revolving Credit Period, each Lender severally agrees, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make loans to any Borrower pursuant to this Section from time to time; provided that, immediately after each such loan is made: 
(i) such Lenders Outstanding Amount shall not exceed its Commitment; and 
(ii) the Total Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments. 
Within the foregoing limits, a Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(a), prepay Loans to the extent permitted by Section 2.11 and reborrow at
any time during the Revolving Credit Period under this Section 2.01. Each Borrowing under this Section shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (except that (i) any such Borrowing may be
in the aggregate amount at the time available under this Section and (ii) any Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.18(c)(ii) may be in the amount of the related Reimbursement Obligation) and shall be made from the several Lenders ratably in
proportion to their respective Commitments. 
   31 






 (b) Following the first anniversary of the Effective Date, the Termination Date may be
extended on up to two occasions in the manner set forth in this subsection (b) for a period of one year from the Termination Date then in effect; provided that (x) the Termination Date shall not be extended more than once in any
twelve-month period and (y) in no event shall the Termination Date be later than September 27, 2028. If the Company wishes to request an extension of the Termination Date, the Company shall give notice to that effect to the Administrative
Agent, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each of the Lenders of such request. Each Lender will use its best efforts to respond to such request, whether affirmatively or negatively, as it may elect in its sole discretion,
within 30 days of such notice to the Administrative Agent. Any Lender not responding to such request within such time period shall be deemed to have responded negatively to such request. The Company may request the Lenders that do not elect to
extend the Termination Date to assign their Commitments in their entirety to one or more Assignees pursuant to Section 11.06 which Assignees will agree to extend the Termination Date. If Lenders having more than 50% of the aggregate amount of
the Commitments (including such Assignees and excluding their respective transferor Lenders) respond affirmatively, then, subject to receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts of an Extension Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit F
hereto duly completed and signed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and such Lenders, the Termination Date shall be extended to the first anniversary of the Termination Date then in effect with respect to such Lenders (but not with respect to
Lenders not so responding affirmatively). Any extension of the Termination Date pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02(b) and Section 3.02(c), and any request for
an extension by the Company hereunder shall constitute a representation and warranty that such conditions are satisfied at the time of such extension and after giving effect thereto. 
SECTION 2.02. Notice of Borrowing. The relevant Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice signed by a
Responsible Officer of such Borrower (a Notice of Borrowing) not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the date of each Base Rate Borrowing and (y) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before each Euro-Dollar
Borrowing, specifying:  (a) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic Business Day in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing or a
Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing;  (b) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing; 
(c) whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to bear interest initially at the Base Rate or the Euro-Dollar Rate; and 
(d) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the
definition of Interest Period.  SECTION 2.03. Notice to Lenders; Fundings of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof 
   32 






 
and of such Lenders share of such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the relevant Borrower. 
(b) Not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing, each Lender shall make available its share of such Borrowing,
in federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 11.01. Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article 3 has not
been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the relevant Borrower at the Administrative Agents aforesaid address. 
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing (or prior to 3:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the date of any Base Rate Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, a rate per
annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.06 and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 
(d) Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to any Eligible Subsidiary which is not organized under the laws of the United
States or any political subdivision thereof by causing any foreign or domestic branch or affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of such Eligible Subsidiary to
repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  SECTION 2.04. Registry; Notes. (a) The Administrative
Agent shall maintain a register (the Register) in which it will record the Commitment of each Lender, each Loan made by each Lender and each repayment of any Loan. Any such recordation by the Administrative Agent in the Register
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Each Lender shall record in its internal records the foregoing information as to its own Commitment and Loans. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of the Loans.  (b) Each Lender may, by notice to a Borrower and the Administrative Agent,
request (i) that its Loans to such Borrower be evidenced by a single Note payable to such Lender or its registered assigns in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans or (ii) that its Loans of a particular
type to such Borrower be evidenced by a separate Note of such 
   33 






 
Borrower in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans. Each such Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with any appropriate modifications to
reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans of a particular type. Each reference in this Agreement to the Note of such Lender shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require. 
SECTION 2.05. Maturity of Loans. Each Loan shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the
Termination Date.  SECTION 2.06. Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the applicable Base Rate Margin plus the Base Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable at maturity, quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date prior to maturity and, with respect to the principal amount of any Base Rate Loan converted to a Euro-Dollar Loan, on the day such principal amount is so converted. Any
overdue principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day. 
(b) Subject to Section 8.01, each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during
each Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin as applicable to such Euro-Dollar Loan plus the Euro-Dollar Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each
Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. 
(c) Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid, at a rate per
annum equal to the higher of (i) the sum of 1% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (x) the rate at which one day (or, if such amount
due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than three months as the Administrative Agent may select) deposits in dollars are offered by the principal London office of the
Administrative Agent in the London interbank market for the applicable period determined as provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.01 shall
exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day) and (ii) the sum of 1% plus the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the Euro-Dollar Rate applicable to such Loan on the day
such payment was due.  (d) The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the relevant Borrower and the Lenders of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
   34 






 SECTION 2.07. Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Facility Fee Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding
the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lenders
Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand.  (b) The Company shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders
ratably a letter of credit fee accruing daily on the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Euro-Dollar Margin for such day and (ii) to each Issuing Lender a letter of credit
fronting fee accruing daily on the aggregate amount then available for drawing under all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender at such rate per annum as may be mutually agreed between the Company and such Issuing Lender from time to time.
 (c) Fees accrued for the account of the Lenders under this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date
and on the day on which the Commitments terminate in their entirety (and, if later, on the day on which the aggregate Outstanding Amount is reduced to zero). 
SECTION 2.08. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. During the Revolving Credit Period, the Company may, upon at least
three Domestic Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding at such time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time, by an aggregate
amount of $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, the aggregate amount of the Commitments; provided that no such reduction shall be permitted if it would cause the Total Outstanding Amount to exceed the aggregate amount of the
Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of any such termination or reduction of the Commitments. 
SECTION 2.09. Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a) The Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at
the type of rate specified by a Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. Thereafter, a Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each case to the provisions
of Article 8) as follows:  (i) if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the relevant Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day; and 
   35 






 (ii) if such Loans are Euro-Dollar
Loans, the relevant Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or elect to continue such Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, subject to Section 2.13 in the case
of any such conversion or continuation effective on any day other than the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans.  Each
such election shall be made by delivering a written notice signed by a Responsible Officer of the relevant Borrower (a Notice of Interest Rate Election) to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on
the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective. A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the
aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to
which it does not apply, are each $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000.  (b) Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
specify:  (i) the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice applies; 
(ii) the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the
applicable clause of subsection (a) above;  (iii) if the Loans comprising such Group are to be converted, the new type
of Loans and, if the Loans being converted are to be Euro-Dollar Loans, the duration of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable thereto; and 
(iv) if such Loans are to be continued as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest
Period, the duration of such additional Interest Period.  Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall comply with the
provisions of the definition of Interest Period.  (c) Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election from a Borrower pursuant to
subsection (a) above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by such Borrower. If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Interest
Rate Election to the Administrative Agent for any Group of Euro-Dollar Loans, such Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto 
SECTION 2.10. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans then
outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.  SECTION 2.11. Optional
Prepayments. (a) Subject in the case of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing to Section 2.13, any Borrower may, upon at least one Domestic Business Days written 
   36 






 
notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Group of Base Rate Loans or upon at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days written notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Group of
Euro-Dollar Loans, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the
date of prepayment and any payments in respect of funding losses required by Section 2.13. Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Lenders included in such Group. 
(b) Upon receipt of a written notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
contents thereof and of such Lenders ratable share of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the relevant Borrower. 
SECTION 2.12. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrowers shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on,
the Loans, of Letter of Credit Liabilities and of fees hereunder not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date when due, in federal or other funds immediately available in New York City and without setoff, recoupment or counterclaim, to
the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 11.01. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders.
Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever
any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time. 
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due from such Borrower
to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.  (c) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.12(b), 2.18(c) or 2.18(f), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent 
   37 






 
or any Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 
(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest or fees on any of its Loans or participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements and
accrued interest and/or fees thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in the Letter of Credit
Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and
participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to a Borrower or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation.  SECTION 2.13. Funding Losses. If a Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Euro-Dollar
Loan or any Euro-Dollar Loan is converted (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period fixed pursuant to Section 2.06(c), or if
a Borrower fails to borrow, prepay, convert or continue any Euro-Dollar Loans after notice has been given to any Lender in accordance with Section 2.03(a), 2.09(c) or 2.11(b), the relevant Borrower shall reimburse each Lender within 15 days
after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties,
but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or conversion or failure to borrow, prepay, convert or continue; provided that such Lender shall have delivered to the Company a certificate as to the amount of such loss or
expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  SECTION 2.14. Computation of Interest and
Fees. Interest based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and
fees under this Article 2 shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All interest 
   38 






 
hereunder on any Loan shall be computed on a daily basis based upon the outstanding principal amount of such Loan as of the applicable date of determination. 
SECTION 2.15. Judgment Currency. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from
any Borrower hereunder or under any of the Notes in dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase dollars with such other currency at the Administrative Agents New York office on the Domestic Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The Obligations of each
Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the Domestic Business Day
following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures
purchase dollars with such other currency; if the amount of dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in dollars, each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of dollars so purchased exceeds (a) the sum
originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 11.04, such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the appropriate Borrower.  SECTION 2.16.
Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers. (a) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to or of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit for the account of an Eligible Subsidiary is increased, or the amount of any sum received
or receivable by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) is reduced by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Eligible Subsidiary is organized in, or conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the
United States (a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower), the Company shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent); provided,
however, this Section 2.16(a) shall not apply with respect to Taxes. A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under this subsection 2.16(a) and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  (b) Each Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of
which it has knowledge that will entitle such Lender to additional interest or payments pursuant to subsection 2.16(a) and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation will avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 
   39 






 (c) Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to any Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower by causing any foreign or domestic branch or affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.  SECTION 2.17. Regulation D Compensation. Each Lender may require a Borrower to pay,
contemporaneously with each payment of interest by such Borrower on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Borrower, additional interest on the related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Lender at a rate per annum determined by such Lender up to but not exceeding the
excess of (i) (A) the applicable Euro-Dollar Rate divided by (B) one minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable Euro-Dollar Rate. Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest
(x) shall so notify the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each
Interest Period commencing at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify the relevant Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the
Euro-Dollar Loans of the amount then due it under this Section 2.17.  Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage means for any
day that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York
City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in respect of Eurocurrency liabilities (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Lender to United States residents). 
SECTION 2.18. Letters of Credit.  
(a) Commitment to Issue Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and so long as no Stop Issuance Notice is in
effect, each Issuing Lender agrees to issue Letters of Credit from time to time before the Letter of Credit Termination Date upon the request of any Borrower; provided that immediately after each Letter of Credit is issued (i) the Total
Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments, (ii) the Letter of Credit Liabilities outstanding with respect to such Issuing Lender shall not exceed such Issuing Lenders Letter of Credit Sublimit,
(iii) the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit referred to in clause (a) of the definition thereof and (iv) no Lenders Credit Exposure shall exceed its Commitment.
Upon the date of issuance by an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party
hereto, to have purchased from the Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Liabilities in the proportion its respective Commitment bears to the aggregate Commitments. In the event the Commitments
shall have been extended pursuant to Section 2.01(b) with respect to some but not all Lenders, and as a result the Termination Date applicable to a Lender falls prior to the expiry date of a Letter of Credit then outstanding, such

   40 






 
Lenders participation in such Letter of Credit shall terminate on its Termination Date, and the participations of the other Lenders therein shall be redetermined pro rata to their
respective Percentages after giving effect to the termination of the Commitment of such former Lender. If and to the extent necessary to permit redetermination of the participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence within the
limits of the Commitments which are not terminated, the Borrowers shall prepay on such date all or a portion of the outstanding Loans, and such redetermination and termination of participations in outstanding Letters of Credit shall be conditioned
upon their having done so.  (b) Method for Issuance; Terms; Extensions. 
(i) The Borrower shall give the Issuing Lender notice at least three Domestic Business Days (or such shorter notice as may be
acceptable to the Issuing Lender in its discretion) prior to the requested issuance of a Letter of Credit (or, in the case of renewal or extension, prior to the Issuing Lenders deadline for notice of nonextension) specifying the date such
Letter of Credit is to be issued, and describing the terms of such Letter of Credit and the nature of the transactions to be supported thereby (such notice, including any such notice given in connection with the extension of a Letter of Credit, a
Notice of Issuance). Upon receipt of a Notice of Issuance, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and of the amount
of such Lenders participation in such Letter of Credit.  (ii) The obligation of the Issuing Lender to issue each
Letter of Credit shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02, be subject to the conditions precedent that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuing Lender and that the Borrower shall have executed and delivered such other instruments and agreements relating to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Lender shall have reasonably requested. The Borrower shall also pay to the Issuing Lender
for its own account issuance, drawing, amendment and extension charges in the amounts and at the times as agreed between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender. An Issuing Lender shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:
(i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Lender shall prohibit,
or require that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable on the Effective Date and
that such Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it; or (ii) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally. 
   41 






 (iii) The extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be
an issuance of such Letter of Credit, and if any Letter of Credit contains a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to be extended unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing Lender, the Issuing Lender shall timely give such notice of
termination unless it has theretofore timely received a Notice of Issuance and the other conditions to issuance of a Letter of Credit have also theretofore been met with respect to such extension. No Letter of Credit shall have a term of more than
twelve months; provided that a Letter of Credit may contain a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to be extended on an annual basis unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing Lender; provided, further that no
Letter of Credit shall have a term extending or be so extendible beyond the Letter of Credit Termination Date.  (c) Payments;
Reimbursement Obligations.  (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing
under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid as a result of such demand or drawing and the
date such payment is to be made by the Issuing Lender (the Payment Date). The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any amounts paid by the Issuing Lender upon any drawing
under any Letter of Credit, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. Such reimbursement shall be due on the Payment Date; provided that no such payment shall be due from the Borrower any earlier than the date of
receipt by it of notice of its obligation to make such payment (or, if such notice is received by the Borrower after 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any date, on the next succeeding Domestic Business Day); and provided,
further that if and to the extent any such reimbursement is not made by the Borrower in accordance with this clause (i) or clause (ii) on the Payment Date, then (irrespective of when notice thereof is received by the Borrower),
such reimbursement obligation shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the Payment Date to but not including the date such reimbursement obligation is paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to
Base Rate Loans for such day.  (ii) All such amounts paid by the Issuing Lender and remaining unpaid by the Borrower (a
Reimbursement Obligation) shall, if and to the extent that the amount of such Reimbursement Obligation would be permitted as a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.01, and unless the Borrower otherwise instructs the Administrative
Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date payment of such Reimbursement Obligation is due, convert automatically to Base Rate Loans on such date. The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the applicable Borrower (which
hereby irrevocably directs the Administrative Agent so to act on its behalf), give notice no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such date requesting each Lender to make, and each Lender hereby agrees to make, a Base Rate Loan, in an
amount equal to such Lenders Percentage of the Reimbursement Obligation with respect to which such notice relates. Each Lender shall make such Loan available to the Administrative Agent at its address specified in or

   42 






 
pursuant to Section 2.12 in immediately available funds, not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time), on the date specified in such notice. The Administrative Agent shall pay the proceeds
of such Loans to the Issuing Lender, which shall immediately apply such proceeds to repay the Reimbursement Obligation. 
(iii) To the extent the Reimbursement Obligation is not refunded by a Lender pursuant to clause (ii) above, such Lender
will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, immediately upon the Issuing Lenders demand at any time during the period commencing after such Reimbursement Obligation arises until reimbursement therefor in full
by the Borrower, an amount equal to such Lenders Percentage of such Reimbursement Obligation, together with interest on such amount for each day from the date of the Issuing Lenders demand for such payment (or, if such demand is made
after 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date, from the next succeeding Domestic Business Day) to the date of payment by such Lender of such amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for the first three Domestic
Business Days after the date of such demand and thereafter at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for each additional day. The Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender ratably all amounts received from the Borrower for application in payment of
its Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to the Issuing Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit pursuant hereto; provided that in the event such payment received
by the Issuing Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Issuing Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Issuing Lender. 
(d) Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Borrower and each Lender under subsection (c) above shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation the following circumstances: 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto;
 (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of this Agreement or any
Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto;  (iii) the use which may be made of the Letter of Credit by, or
any acts or omission of, a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting);  (iv)
the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other rights that the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting), any
Lender (including the Issuing Lender) or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or the Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto or any unrelated transaction; 
   43 






 (v) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit
proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; 
(vi) payment under a Letter of Credit against presentation to the Issuing Lender of documents that do not comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit; provided that this clause (vi) shall not limit the rights of the Borrower under Section 2.18(e)(ii); or 
(vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), the Administrative
Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this subsection (vii), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to the Borrowers or the Lenders obligations
hereunder.  (e) Indemnification; Expenses. 
(i) Each Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Lender (including each Issuing Lender) and the Administrative
Agent from and against any and all Liabilities, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur in connection with a Letter of Credit issued, renewed or extended pursuant to this Section 2.18, including those incurred in connection with
proceedings brought or threatened by the Company or any of its affiliates, equity holders or creditors; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender or the Administrative Agent for any Liabilities, costs or
expenses to the extent found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (A) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person or (B) a
material breach by such Person of the express provisions of this Agreement.  (ii) None of the Lenders (including an Issuing
Lender) nor the Administrative Agent nor any of their officers or directors or employees or agents shall be liable or responsible, by reason of or in connection with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any
Letter of Credit, including without limitation any of the circumstances enumerated in subsection (d) above; provided that, notwithstanding Section 2.18(d), the Borrower shall have a claim for direct (but not consequential) damage
suffered by it, to the extent finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (x) subject to the following sentence, the Issuing Lenders gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether
documents presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (y) the Issuing Lenders failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documents strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. The parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are
not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
   44 






 (iii) Nothing in this subsection (e) is intended to limit the
obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement. To the extent the Borrower does not indemnify an Issuing Lender as required by this subsection, the Lenders agree to do so ratably in accordance with their Commitments. 
(f) Existing Letters of Credit; Designation of Additional Letters of Credit.  
(i) On the Effective Date, without further action by any party hereto (A) each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed
to be a Letter of Credit issued hereunder on such date and (B) each issuer of an Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have granted to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed to have acquired from each issuer of an Existing Letter
of Credit, a participation in each Existing Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.18(a).  (ii) From time to
time after the Effective Date, any Borrower may designate any letter of credit theretofore issued by a Lender for the account of such Borrower as a Letter of Credit hereunder by three Domestic Business Days notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent; provided that any such designation shall be subject to all terms and conditions governing the issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder. Upon the effective date of such notice, if the applicable conditions to issuance of
such a Letter of Credit would be satisfied on such date, such outstanding letter of credit shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit issued hereunder on such date, and the issuer thereof shall be deemed to have granted to each Lender, and each Lender
shall be deemed to have acquired from such issuer, a participation therein in accordance with Section 2.18(a). Each Lender which is the issuer of any such letter of credit shall be entitled to the benefits of, and shall be bound by the
provisions applicable to, an Issuing Lender with respect to any letter of credit so designated as a Letter of Credit.  (g) Letters of
Credit Issued for the Account of Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the account
party, applicant, customer, instructing party, or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of the applicable Issuing Lender (whether arising by contract, at law, in
equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the Company (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the applicable Issuing Lender hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to reimburse any and all
drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the Company and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the
Obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Company, and that the Companys business derives
substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.  SECTION 2.19. Stop Issuance Notice. If the Required Lenders
determine at any time that the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at such time, then the Required Lenders may request that the Administrative Agent issue a Stop Issuance

   45 






 
Notice, and the Administrative Agent shall issue such notice to each Issuing Lender. Such Stop Issuance Notice shall be withdrawn upon a determination by the Required Lenders that
the circumstances giving rise thereto no longer exist. No Letter of Credit shall be issued or extended while a Stop Issuance Notice is in effect. The Required Lenders may request issuance of a Stop Issuance Notice only if there is a reasonable basis
therefor, and shall consider reasonably and in good faith a request from the Borrower for withdrawal of the same on the basis that the conditions in Section 3.02 are satisfied; provided that the Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Lenders may and shall conclusively rely on any Stop Issuance Notice while it remains in effect.  SECTION 2.20.
Optional Increase in Commitments. Following the Effective Date, the Company may, if it so elects, increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments, either by designating a financial institution not theretofore a Lender (an
Additional Lender) to become a Lender (such designation to be effective only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender, which consents will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or by
agreeing with an existing Lender that such Lenders Commitment shall be increased. Upon execution and delivery by the Company and such Lender or Additional Lender of an instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
together with such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on the part of the Company with respect to the increased Commitments and such opinions of counsel for the Company with respect to the increased Commitments as the Administrative
Agent may request, such existing Lender shall have a Commitment as therein set forth or such other financial institution shall become a Lender with a Commitment as therein set forth and all the rights and obligations of a Lender with such a
Commitment hereunder; provided:  (i) that the Company shall provide prompt notice of such increase to the
Administrative Agent, who shall promptly notify the Lenders;  (ii) the conditions set forth in Sections 3.02(b) and
(c) shall be satisfied both on and as of the date of such notice and on and as of the effective date of any increase in Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20; 
(iii) that any such increase shall be in an amount which is a multiple of $10,000,000; 
(iv) that immediately after such increase is made, the aggregate amount of increases in the Commitments pursuant to this
Section 2.20, shall not exceed $500,000,000; and  (v) that the Company may elect to increase the aggregate amount of
the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20 no more than twice in any calendar year.  On the effective date of any increase in the
aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20, (i) each Additional Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate outstanding Loans (and funded participations, if
any, in Letters of Credit) and (ii) any Lender whose Commitment has been increased (an Increasing  
   46 






 
Lender) shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the increase in its pro rata share of the aggregate outstanding Loans (and funded participations as above), in each
case such payments shall be for the account of each other Lender. Upon receipt of such amount by the Administrative Agent, (A) each other Lender shall be deemed to have ratably assigned that portion of its outstanding Loans that is being
reduced to the Additional Lenders and the Increasing Lenders in accordance with such Lenders new Commitment or the increased portion thereof as applicable, (B) the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each other Lender its
ratable share of the amounts received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this paragraph and (C) the participations of the Lenders in outstanding Letters of Credit shall be determined in accordance with their Commitments after giving effect
to such increase. For the avoidance of doubt, no existing Lender shall have any obligation to participate in such increase except in its absolute and sole discretion. 
SECTION 2.21. Defaulting Lenders. (a) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply
for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  (i) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the
Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.07(a);  (ii) any payment of principal, interest, fees or
other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 6 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant
to Section 11.04 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender hereunder; third, to cash collateralize Letter of Credit Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with
this Section; fourth, as the Company may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement,
as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future
funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) cash collateralize future Letter of Credit Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in
accordance with this Section; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or Issuing Lender against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company
as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and
eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; 
   47 






 
provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Letter of Credit Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded
its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of,
and Letter of Credit Disbursements owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Letter of Credit Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting
Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in the Companys obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments
without giving effect to clause (b) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this
Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents thereto; and 
(iii) the Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have
taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 11.05); 
(b) If any Letter of Credit Liabilities exist at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
(i) all or any part of the Letter of Credit Liabilities of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages but only to the extent that (a) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Credit Exposures plus
such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Liabilities does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments and (b) such reallocation does not, as to any non-Defaulting Lender, cause such non-Defaulting Lenders Credit Exposure to exceed such non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment;
 (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall
within one Domestic Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Liabilities
(after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.03 for so long as such Letter of Credit Liabilities remain outstanding; 
(iii) to the extent that the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit
Liabilities pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.07(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Liabilities during the
period such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Liabilities is cash collateralized; 
   48 






 (iv) to the extent that the Letter of Credit Liabilities of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the letter of credit fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.07(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Percentages; and  (v) to the extent that all or any portion
of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Liabilities is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender
hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.07(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Liabilities shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until all such Letter of Credit Liabilities are reallocated
and/or cash collateralized; and  (vi) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to
issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.21(b)(ii), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be
allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(b)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein); 
provided that, subject to Section 11.14, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting
Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.  (c) If an Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has
defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Lender shall have
entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Issuing Lender to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. 
(d) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Issuing Lenders agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all
matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Letter of Credit Liabilities of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender shall (i) purchase at par
such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Percentage and (ii) pay to each Lender from which such Loans are so purchased
an amount equal to the amount that the Borrower would owe to each such Lender in respect of funding losses pursuant to Section 2.13 if the Borrower repaid such Loans on such date. 
(e) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions 
   49 






 
contained in Section 11.06), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld and (ii) such Lender shall have
received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to
the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrower (in the case of all other amounts). Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be
effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved
Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to
have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as
reasonably requested by the applicable Lender; provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

operations conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and

be binding upon each Lender and each Issuing Lender; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that (i) the Administrative Agent in good faith believes exposes it to liability unless
the Administrative Agent receives an indemnification and is exculpated in a manner satisfactory to it from the Lenders and the Issuing 
   63 






 
Lenders with respect to such action or (ii) is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law, including any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay
under any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any requirement of law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors; provided, further, that the Administrative Agent may seek clarification or direction from the Required Lenders prior to the exercise of any such instructed action and may
refrain from acting until such clarification or direction has been provided. Except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Company, any Subsidiary or any affiliate of any of the foregoing that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates in any capacity. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Administrative Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.  (c) In
performing its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is acting solely on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders (except in limited circumstances expressly provided for herein relating to
the maintenance of the Register), and its duties are entirely mechanical and administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
(i) the Administrative Agent does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or duty or any other
relationship as the agent, fiduciary or trustee of or for any Lender or Issuing Lender other than as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
(and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or other implied (or
express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties); additionally,
each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby; 
(ii) nothing in this Agreement or any Loan Document shall require the Administrative Agent to account to any Lender for any sum
or the profit element of any sum received by the Administrative Agent for its own account;  (d) The Administrative Agent may perform any of
its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their 
   64 






 respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities pursuant to this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that
the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent. 
(e) None of any Syndication Agent or any Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner shall have obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder. 
(f) In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to the Company or any other Borrower under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Company) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans,
Letter of Credit Disbursements and all other Obligations of any Borrower that are owing and unpaid under any Loan Document and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under Sections 2.06, 2.07, 8.04 and 11.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
(ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Lender and each Issuing Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 11.03). Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuing Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations of the Company or any other Borrower hereunder or the rights of any Lender or
Issuing Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuing Lender in any such proceeding. 
(g) The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and, except
solely to the extent of the Companys rights to consent pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article, none of the Company or 
   65 






 
any Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates, shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary under any such provisions. 
SECTION 7.02. Administrative Agent and Affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
business with any Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of any Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 7.03.
Administrative Agents Reliance, Limitation of Liability, Etc.  (a) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its Related Parties shall be (i) liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by such party, the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (x) with the
consent of or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the
Loan Documents) or (y) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and
non-appealable judgment) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Borrower or any officer thereof contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Administrative Agents reliance on any Electronic Signature
transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page) or for any failure of any Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. 
(b) The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any notice of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written
notice thereof (stating that it is a notice of Default or a notice of an Event of Default) is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company, a Lender or an Issuing Lender. Further, the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered
thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the
sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 3 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other
than to confirm receipt of items (which on their face purport to be such items) expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent 
   66 






 
or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (i) may treat the payee of any promissory note as its holder until such
promissory note has been assigned in accordance with Section 11.06, (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to the Company), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts, (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender or Issuing Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender or
Issuing Lender for any statements, warranties or representations made by or on behalf of any Borrower in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (iv) in determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a
Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Lender sufficiently in advance of the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (v) shall be entitled to rely on, and shall incur no liability under
or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon, any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which writing may be a fax, any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other
distribution) or any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper party or parties (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in
the Loan Documents for being the maker thereof).  SECTION 7.04. Posting of
Communications. (a) The Company agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communications available to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders by posting the Communications on IntraLinks, DebtDomain, SyndTrak, ClearPar or any other electronic platform chosen by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the Approved Electronic
Platform).  (b) Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable
security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Effective Date, a user ID/password authorization system) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the
Lenders, each of the Issuing Lenders and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the
representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Lenders and the Company
hereby approves distribution of the Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution. 
   67 






 (c) THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED AS IS
AND AS AVAILABLE. THE APPLICABLE PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS
IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE APPLICABLE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY JOINT LEAD ARRANGER AND
JOINT BOOKRUNNER, ANY SYNDICATION AGENT OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, APPLICABLE PARTIES) HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY BORROWER, ANY LENDER, ANY ISSUING LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY BORROWERS OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS TRANSMISSION OF
COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.  Communications means, collectively, any notice, demand,
communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender
by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through an Approved Electronic Platform.  (d) Each Lender and
each Issuing Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Approved Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes
of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic communication) from time to time of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders (as
applicable) email address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email address. 
(e) Each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Lenders and the Company agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be required
by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agents generally applicable document retention procedures and policies. 
(f) Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender to give any notice or other
communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document. 
   68 






 SECTION 7.05. The Administrative Agent Individually. With respect to its Commitment,
Loans and Letters of Credit, the Person serving as the Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other
Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be. The terms Issuing Lenders, Lenders, Required Lenders and any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in
its individual capacity as a Lender, Issuing Lender or as one of the Required Lenders, as applicable. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial
advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with, the Company, any Subsidiary or any affiliate of any of the foregoing as if such Person was not acting as the Administrative
Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders.  SECTION 7.06. Successor Administrative
Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Company, whether or not a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed. Upon
any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within
30 days after the retiring Administrative Agents giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank
with an office in New York, New York or an affiliate of any such bank. In either case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Company (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be required while an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of appointment as Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Prior to any retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to
the successor Administrative Agent its rights as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.  (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of
this Section, in the event no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring
Administrative Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Company, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (i) the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; and (ii) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent; provided that (A) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent shall be made directly to
such Person and (B) all notices and other 
   69 






 
communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the Administrative Agent shall directly be given or made to each Lender and each Issuing Lender. Following the effectiveness of the
Administrative Agents resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue
in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring
Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.  SECTION 7.07. Administrative Agents Fee. The Company
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent. 
SECTION 7.08 Acknowledgements of Lenders and Issuing Lenders. (a) Each Lender and each Issuing Lender represents and warrants that
(i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility, (ii) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender or
Issuing Lender, in each case in the ordinary course of business, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument (and each Lender and each Issuing Lender agrees not to assert a claim in
contravention of the foregoing), (iii) it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, any Syndication Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Lender, or any of the Related Parties
of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder and (iv) it is
sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in
making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities. Each Lender and each Issuing Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, any Syndication Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the
foregoing, and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Company and its affiliates) as
it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 (b) Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement on the Effective Date, or delivering its signature page to an
Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be
delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Effective Date. 
   70 






 (c) (i) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such
Lender that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or
otherwise; individually and collectively, a Payment) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but
in no event later than one (1) Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of
each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim,
counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received, including without limitation any
defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender under this Section 7.08(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
(ii) Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates
(x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a Payment Notice) or
(y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a
Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one
(1) Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including
the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.  (iii) The Company and each Eligible Subsidiary
hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of
such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Company or any other Eligible Subsidiary; except, in each case, to the extent such
erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent 
   71 






 
from (or on behalf of ) the Company or any Eligible Subsidiary for the purpose of making such Payment. 
(iv) Each partys obligations under this Section 7.08(c) shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document. 
SECTION 7.09. Certain ERISA Matters. (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender
party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and each Joint Lead Arranger and Joint

 (iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a Qualified Professional Asset Manager (within the

ARTICLE 8  CHANGE
IN CIRCUMSTANCES  SECTION 8.01. Alternate Rate of Interest. 
(a) Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 8.01, if on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period
for any Euro-Dollar Loan:  (i) the Administrative Agent determines that adequate and fair means do not exist for
determining the Euro-Dollar Rate for such Interest Period, or  (ii) the Required Lenders advise the Administrative Agent
that the Euro-Dollar Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans (including because the Euro-Dollar Screen Rate is not available or published on a
current bases) for such Interest Period; provided that no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time,  the Administrative Agent
shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (iii) the obligations of the Lenders to
make Euro-Dollar Loans or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended and (iv) each outstanding Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest
Period applicable thereto. Unless the Company notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow
on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any
other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event, an Early Opt-in Election or an Other Benchmark Rate Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the
Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark

setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause
(3) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at
or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or
any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, if a Term
SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for
all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
provided that, this clause (c) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Company a Term SOFR Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver

Early Opt-in Election or an Other Benchmark Rate Election, as applicable, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be
made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 8.01, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or
non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or
their sole discretion and without consent from any 
   74 






 
other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 8.01. 
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation
of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Euro-Dollar Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such
rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that
any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of
Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.  (g) Upon the
Companys receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, any Borrower may revoke any request for a Euro-Dollar Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Euro-Dollar Loans to be made, converted or continued
during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, each Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any
time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate. 
SECTION 8.02. Illegality. (a) If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans to any Borrower and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Company and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such
Lender to make Euro-Dollar Loans to such Borrower, or to convert outstanding Loans to such Borrower into Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section, such Lender shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender. If such notice is given, each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Lender then outstanding to such Borrower shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to
such Euro-Dollar Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day. 
   75 






 (b) If by reason of the fact that an Eligible Subsidiary is organized in, or conducts
business in, a jurisdiction outside the United States, it is unlawful, in the sole determination of any Lender, for such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to make or maintain Loans to such Eligible Subsidiary and such Lender shall so notify
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Company and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Lender to make or maintain Loans to such Eligible Subsidiary shall be suspended. If such notice is given, each Loan of such Lender then outstanding to such Eligible Subsidiary shall either
(i) if such Lender, the Company and the Administrative Agent agree, be made or transferred (as applicable) to the Company as Borrower (but shall otherwise continue to be part of the same Borrowing to such Eligible Subsidiary for other purposes
of this Agreement) or (ii) if clause (i) does not apply, shall be prepaid either (x) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Loan, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto if such Lender may lawfully continue to
maintain such Loan to such day or (y) immediately if clause (x) does not apply.  SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced
Return. (a) If any Change in Law shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such
requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) or shall subject any Lender to any taxes (other than (i) any taxes indemnified under Section 8.04, (ii) taxes excluded in the definition of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i) of such definition) or
(iii) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans, loan principal, Letters of Credit, Commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable or allocated thereto, or impose on any Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) or on the London interbank market any other condition (other than the imposition of any taxes) affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Notes, its participation in the Letters of Credit or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar
Loans or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan (or, in the case of a Change in Law
with respect to taxes, any Loan) or of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Notes
with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or shall cause another Borrower to pay) to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.  (b) If any Lender shall have determined
that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Lenders obligations hereunder to a level below
that which such Lender (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time,
within 15 days after demand by such Lender 
   76 






 
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its Parent) for such reduction. 
(c) Each Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date
hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of
such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate of any Lender claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  SECTION 8.04.
Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Section 8.04, the following terms have the following meanings: 
Taxes means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect
to any payment by any Borrower or the Company pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net income,
and franchise or similar taxes (x) imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each
Lender, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located or (y) that are Other Connection Taxes, (ii) in the case of each Lender, any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments, but only up to the rate (if any) at which United
States withholding tax would apply to such payments to such Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement or such Lender changes its Applicable Lending Office and (iii) any United States withholding tax imposed under
FATCA.  Other Taxes means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or
similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the execution, performance, enforcement or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note. 
(b) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower or the Company to or for the account of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any Borrower, the Company or the Administrative Agent shall be required by law to deduct any
Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable by the Borrower or the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower, the Company or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall
make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower, the Company or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) if the
withholding agent is 
   77 






 
the Borrower or the Company, the Borrower or the Company shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 11.01, the original or a certified copy of
a receipt evidencing payment thereof, a copy of the return reporting payment thereof or other evidence of payment thereof reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(c) The Company shall timely pay to the relevant taxation authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.  (d) The Company agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall provide a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Company setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts. This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. 
(e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of
this Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the
Administrative Agent (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Company and the Administrative Agent with Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (together with, in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, a certificate to the
effect that such Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a
controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate)), W-8IMY (accompanied by form
W-8ECI, form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable) or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service. Each Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to
the date on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Administrative Agent (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall
provide the Company and the Administrative Agent with Internal Revenue Service form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding. 
(f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Company or the Administrative Agent with the appropriate form
pursuant to Section 8.04(e) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification
under 
   78 






 
Section 8.04(b) or (d) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding
tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrowers shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes. 
(g) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Note would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such
Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied
with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the purposes of this Section 8.04(g), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of
this Agreement, whether or not included in the definition of FATCA.  (h) If any Borrower or the Company is required to pay additional
amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section, then such Lender will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Lender, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such
additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.  (i) Each Lender shall
severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes and Other Taxes (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation, if any,
of the Borrowers to do so) or any taxes excluded from the definition of Taxes, in each case attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 15 days from the date the Administrative Agent makes demand therefor. 
(j) If any party determines, in its sole reasonable discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any taxes as to which
it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.04 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 8.04), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over
pursuant to this Section 8.04(j) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such taxing authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary 
   79 






 
in this paragraph, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the indemnified party
in a less favorable net after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the tax subject to the indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise
imposed and the indemnity payments with respect to such tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems
confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  (k) Each partys obligations under this Section 8.04 shall survive
the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement. 
SECTION 8.05. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Rate. If (i) the obligation of any Lender to make, or
convert outstanding Loans to, Euro-Dollar Loans to any Borrower has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect
to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the relevant Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior notice to such Lender through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this
Section shall apply to such Lender, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist, all Loans to such Borrower which would otherwise be made by
such Lender as (or continued as or converted into) Euro-Dollar Loans shall instead be Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of
the other Lenders). If such Lender notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer apply, the principal amount of each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Euro-Dollar Loan on the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period applicable to the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Lenders. 
ARTICLE 9

(e) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Company may have at any time against

hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and all other amounts payable by the Company and each Eligible Subsidiary under

hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.  SECTION 11.03. Expenses; Limitation of
Liability; Indemnification. (a) The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including reasonable fees and

agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that, nothing in this Section 11.03(b) shall relieve the 

   83 






 
Company and each other Borrower of (i) any obligation it may have to indemnify an Indemnitee, as provided in Section 11.03(c), against any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third party or (ii) any other obligation of the Company or any other Borrower that is expressly provided for pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
(c) The Company agrees to (i) indemnify each Agent, Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, and Lender, their respective affiliates and
the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an Indemnitee) and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all Liabilities and related expenses of any kind which may be incurred by
such Indemnitee in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration or investigative, administrative or judicial or regulatory action or proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder, including proceedings brought or threatened by the Company or any of its affiliates, equity holders or creditors and
(ii) reimburse each Indemnitee within 30 days after receipt of a reasonably detailed written invoice therefor (together with, if reasonably requested, documentation supporting such reimbursement request) for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including legal expenses of one firm of counsel for all such Indemnitees, taken as a whole, and, if necessary, of a single local counsel in each
appropriate jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions) for all such Indemnitees, taken as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Indemnitee affected by such
conflict informs you of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, of another firm of counsel for such affected Indemnitees)) incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the foregoing, regardless of whether in connection
with any pending or threatened proceeding to which any Indemnitees is a party; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for (A) (1) such Indemnitees own gross negligence or willful misconduct or
(2) a material breach by such Indemnitee of the express provisions of this Agreement, in each case, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (B) any
taxes other than taxes that solely represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-tax claim. 
(d) Each Lender severally agrees to pay any amount required to be paid by the Company under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this
Section 11.03 to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each, an Agent-Related Person) (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without limiting the
obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to their respective Commitment in effect on the date on which such payment is sought under this Section (or, if such payment is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have
terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Commitment immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all Liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent-Related Person in any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the
other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent-Related Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or liability or related expense, as the case 
   84 






 
may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent-Related Person in its capacity as such; provided further that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
Liabilities, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
(e) The Company shall not be liable for any settlement without its prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), but, if settled with the Companys prior written consent or if there is a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company will indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee for Liabilities by reason of such settlement or judgment in accordance with and to the extent such indemnification could have been or is sought pursuant to this Section 11.03. 
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.03 to the contrary, each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all
amounts paid by you under the paragraph above to such indemnified person for any Liabilities or expenses to the extent such indemnified person is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to not be entitled to payment of such amounts in accordance with the terms hereof.  SECTION 11.04. Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Each Lender agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of principal and interest due with respect to the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations of any Borrower held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest
due with respect to the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations of such Borrower held by such other Lender, the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations of such
Borrower held by the other Lenders, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest due with respect to the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations of such Borrower held by the Lenders
shall be shared by the Lenders pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 11.04(a) shall impair the right of any Lender to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to
apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of a Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder.  (b) Each
Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan to such Borrower, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
SECTION 11.05. Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Company and the Required Lenders (and, if the rights or duties of any Issuing Lender or Agent are affected thereby, by it); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall: 
   85 






 (a) unless signed by each affected Lender, (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender or
subject any Lender to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any fees hereunder or (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on
any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any fees hereunder or for the termination of any Commitment or (except as expressly provided in Section 2.18) the expiry date of any Letter of Credit or (iv) release the Company from its obligations
under Article 10; provided, further that, no such amendment or waiver shall (i) unless signed by all the Lenders, change Sections 2.08, 2.12(b) or 2.12(d) in a manner that would alter the ratable reduction of Commitments or the
pro rata sharing of payments required thereby or change the payment waterfall provisions of Sections 2.21(a)(ii) or 6.04 and (ii), unless signed by all the Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender unless such Defaulting Lender is disproportionately
adversely affected by such change) change the percentage of the Credit Exposures which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under this Section 11.05 or any other provision of this Agreement; and provided,
further that no such amendment, waiver or modification shall, unless signed by an Eligible Subsidiary, (w) subject such Eligible Subsidiary to any additional obligation, (x) increase the principal of or rate of interest on any
outstanding Loan of such Eligible Subsidiary or (y) accelerate the stated maturity of any outstanding Loan of such Eligible Subsidiary; or 
(b) unless signed by a Designated Lender or its Designating Lender, (i) subject such Designated Lender to any additional obligation,
(ii) affect its rights hereunder (unless the rights of all the Lenders hereunder are similarly affected) or (iii) change this clause 11.05(b); 
provided that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the applicable Issuing Lender in addition to the Company
and the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the applicable Issuing Lender under this Agreement or any document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it and (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Company and the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that (i) the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of
such Defaulting Lender, (ii) any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for the payment (excluding mandatory prepayments) of principal or interest due to a Defaulting Lender may not be postponed without (A) the consent of
such Defaulting Lender and (B) in connection with the extension of payments of principal or interest which impact all Lenders, the consent of all other Lenders entitled to vote, (iii) the principal of, and the rate of interest specified
herein on, any Loan or unreimbursed Reimbursement Obligation due to a Defaulting Lender may not be reduced without (A) the consent of such Defaulting Lender and (B) in connection with a reduction of the rate of interest specified herein on
any Loan or unreimbursed Reimbursement Obligation which impacts all Lenders, the consent of all other Lenders entitled to vote or (iv) this last sentence of Section 11.05 shall not be amended without the consent of any
Lender that is a Defaulting Lender at the time of such amendment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Administrative Agent and the
Company have jointly identified any ambiguity, mistake, defect, inconsistency, obvious error, omission or 
   86 






 
any other error or omission of a technical nature, in each case, in any provision of any Loan Document, the Company and the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to effect amendments to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, as applicable, solely to address such matter and such amendment shall become effective without the consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as, in each case, the Lenders shall have received at least
ten (10) Business Days prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within ten (10) Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating
that the Required Lenders object to such amendment.  SECTION 11.06. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of all Lenders.  (b) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Company, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, at any time
grant to one or more Lenders or other institutions (other than any Borrower or any affiliate of any Borrower) (each a Participant) participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such
grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrowers and
the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating
interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 11.05(a)
without the consent of the Participant. The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or
other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). 
(c) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other financial institutions other than a Defaulting Lender, any Borrower or any
affiliate of any Borrower (each a Assignee) all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of not less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents) of all, of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and its Notes with respect to Loans and Letters of Credit, and each such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit D (an Assignment and Assumption) hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Lender, with (and subject to) the subscribed consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and (so long as at the time no
Event of Default exists) the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably 
   87 






 
withheld or delayed; provided that (i) no such consent of the Company shall be required if such Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Lender, a Lender prior to such assignment
or an Approved Fund, (ii) the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 15 Domestic Business Days after having received notice thereof
and (iii) if such Assignee is a Lender prior to such assignment, the assignment may be in an amount less than $5,000,000. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such an Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount
equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument
of assumption, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection
(c), the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are issued to the relevant Assignee to evidence its Loans. In connection with any such assignment,
the transferor Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the relevant Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States or a state thereof, it shall
deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.04. 
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes, including to a Federal
Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over it. No such pledge or assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. 
(e) No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Lenders rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 8.03 or 8.04 than such Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Companys prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02,
8.03 or 8.04 requiring such Lender to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. 
(f) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register
on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations hereunder (the Participant Register);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans,
letters of credit or its other obligations hereunder) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5 of the proposed United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat 
   88 






 
each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(g) The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption
Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any
other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  SECTION 11.07. Designated Lenders. (a) Subject to
the provisions of this subsection (a), any Lender may at any time designate an Approved Fund to provide all or a portion of the Loans to be made by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement; provided that such designation shall not be effective
unless the Company and the Administrative Agent consent thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). When a Lender and its Approved Fund shall have signed an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto (a
Designation Agreement) and the Company and the Administrative Agent shall have signed their respective consents thereto, such Approved Fund shall become a Designated Lender for purposes of this Agreement. The Designating Lender
shall thereafter have the right to permit such Designated Lender to provide all or a portion of the Loans to be made by such Designating Lender pursuant to Section 2.01 and the making of such Loans or portion thereof shall satisfy the
obligation of the Designating Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loans or portion thereof were made by the Designating Lender. As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each Designated Lender shall have all the rights that a Lender
making such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement and otherwise; provided that (x) its voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by its Designating Lender and (y) its Designating Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such Designated Lenders obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations in respect of the Loans or portion thereof made by it. Each Designating
Lender shall act as administrative agent for its Designated Lender and give and receive notices and other communications on its behalf. Any payments for the account of any Designated Lender shall be paid to its Designating Lender as administrative
agent for such Designated Lender and neither the Borrower nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Designating Lenders application of such payments. In addition, any Designated Lender may, with notice to (but without the prior
written consent of) the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (i) assign all or portions of its interest in any Loans to its Designating Lender or to any financial institutions consented to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that
provide liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such Designated Lender to support the funding of Loans or portions thereof made by it and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any
non-public information relating to its Loans or portions thereof to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any guarantee, surety, credit or liquidity enhancement to such Designated Lender.

   89 






 (b) Each party to this Agreement agrees that it will not institute against, or join any
other person in instituting against, any Designated Lender any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and a day after all outstanding senior indebtedness
of such Designated Lender is paid in full. The Designating Lender for each Designated Lender agrees to indemnify, save, and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of its inability to institute any
such proceeding against such Designated Lender. This subsection (b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  SECTION
11.08. Collateral. Each of the Lenders represents to each of the Agents and the other Lenders that it in good faith is not relying upon any Margin Stock as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this
Agreement.  SECTION 11.09. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and each Note shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court located in the City of New York, Borough of
Manhattan, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) accepts for itself and in respect of its property the jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) waives any
objection to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (iv) consents to the service of any
process, summons, notice or document in any such suit, action or proceeding by registered mail addressed to the Company (on behalf of the applicable Borrower) at its address specified on signature page hereof. A final judgment in any such suit,
action or proceeding will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing herein will affect the right of any Lender Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law or affect any Lender Partys right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against any Borrower or its property in the courts of other jurisdictions. 
SECTION 11.10. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution. (a) This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes
any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  (b) Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of (x) this Agreement, (y) any other Loan Document and/or (z) any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any notice delivered pursuant to
Section 11.01), certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions contemplated hereby and/or thereby (each an Ancillary Document) that is
an Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement, such other
Loan Document or 
   90 






 
such Ancillary Document, as applicable. The words execution, signed, signature, delivery, and words of like import in or relating to this
Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic
means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping
system, as the case may be; provided that nothing herein shall require the Administrative Agent to accept Electronic Signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent and pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further,
without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept any Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on such Electronic Signature purportedly given
by or on behalf of the Company or any other Borrower without further verification thereof and without any obligation to review the appearance or form of any such Electronic Signature and (ii) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed counterpart. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and each other Borrower hereby (i) agrees that, for all purposes, including without
limitation, in connection with any workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Company and any other Borrower, Electronic Signatures transmitted by telecopy,
emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page and/or any electronic images of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall have the same legal effect, validity
and enforceability as any paper original, (ii) the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document in the form of an imaged
electronic record in any format, which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such Persons business, and destroy the original paper document (and all such electronic records shall be considered an original for all purposes and shall
have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record), (iii) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document
based solely on the lack of paper original copies of this Agreement, such other Loan Document and/or such Ancillary Document, respectively, including with respect to any signature pages thereto and (iv) waives any claim against the
Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner, any Syndication Agent, any Issuing Lender and any Lender, and any Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons for any Liabilities arising solely from the Administrative
Agents and/or any Lenders reliance on or use of Electronic Signatures and/or transmissions by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page, including any Liabilities
arising as a result of the failure of the Company and/or any other Borrower to use any available security measures in connection with the execution, delivery or transmission of any Electronic Signature. 
SECTION 11.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWERS, THE AGENTS, THE ISSUING LENDERS AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING 
   91 






 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 
SECTION 11.12. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001 (the Patriot Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to
identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.  SECTION 11.13. No Fiduciary Duty; Obligations Several. Each
Borrower agrees that in connection with all aspects of the Loans and Letters of Credit contemplated by this Agreement and any communications in connection therewith, the Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Agents,
the Lenders and their respective affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of any Agent, the Lender or their respective affiliates, and no such
duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. The respective obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement are several and not joint and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to satisfy its obligations hereunder.  SECTION 11.14. Acknowledgement and Consent to
Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto
acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down And Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and
agrees to be bound by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such
liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and  (b) the
effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:  (i)
a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such
liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership
will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down And Conversion Powers of
the applicable Resolution Authority.  SECTION 11.15 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To
the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or 
   92 






 
any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support QFC Credit Support and each such QFC a Supported QFC), the parties acknowledge and agree as
follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations
promulgated thereunder, the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact
be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):  In
the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a Covered Party) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit
Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as
the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the
United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or
any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan
Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.  SECTION 11.16
Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information, except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its affiliates and its and its
affiliates respective directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential and the disclosing party shall be responsible for its affiliates compliance with this Section 11.16), (b) to the extent requested by any Governmental Authority
(including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal, judicial, administrative proceeding or
other process (in which case the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, as applicable, agrees (except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any self-regulatory authority or governmental or
regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority) to inform the Company promptly thereof to the extent practicable and not prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation), (d) to any other party to this Agreement otherwise
pursuant to the terms hereof, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the 
   93 






 
enforcement of rights hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee
of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any Swap Agreement relating to the Company and its
obligations, (g) on a confidential basis to (1) any rating agency in connection with rating the Company or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided for herein or (2) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in
connection with the issuance and monitoring of identification numbers with respect to the credit facilities provided for herein, (h) with the consent of the Company, (i) for purposes of establishing a due diligence defense,
(j) to the extent such Information was already in the possession of such Person or is independently developed by such Person or any of its affiliates,and (k) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company that is not, to the knowledge of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, subject to confidentiality obligations to the Company.
For the purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Company relating to the Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any
Issuing Lender or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company and other than information pertaining to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers,
including league table providers, that serve the lending industry; provided that, in the case of information received from the Company after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of
such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. If the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender is requested or required, by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process (other than in connection with any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any self-regulatory authority or governmental or regulatory authority exercising examination or
regulatory authority), to disclose any or all of the Information, the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender will provide the Company with prompt notice of such event (to the extent that such notice does not contravene any
applicable law or similar regulation) so that the Company may, at its own expense, seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing
Lender or such Lender. If the Company determines to seek such protective order or other remedy and provides written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such
Lender will reasonably cooperate with the Company in seeking such protective order or other remedy at the Companys own expense.

paragraph of this Schedule:  Level I Pricing applies on any day on which the Companys long-term debt is rated A- or higher by S&P, A3 or higher by Moodys or A- or higher by Fitch (subject to the final paragraph hereof). 
Level II Pricing applies on any day on which (i) the Companys long-term debt is rated BBB+ or higher by S&P,
Baa1 or higher by Moodys or BBB+ or higher by Fitch (subject to the final paragraph hereof) and (ii) no better Pricing Level applies. 
Level III Pricing applies on any day on which (i) the Companys long-term debt is rated BBB or higher by S&P,
Baa2 or higher by Moodys or BBB or higher by Fitch (subject to the final paragraph hereof) and (ii) no better Pricing Level applies. 
Level IV Pricing applies on any day on which (i) the Companys long-term debt is rated BBB- or higher by S&P, Baa3 or higher by Moodys or BBB- or higher by Fitch (subject to the final paragraph hereof) and (ii) no better Pricing Level applies.
 Level V Pricing applies on any day if no other Pricing Level applies on such day. 
Pricing Level refers to the determination of which of Level I, Level II, Level III, Level IV or Level V Pricing applies on
any day. A better Pricing Level is one with a lower roman numeral.  The credit ratings to be utilized for purposes of this
Schedule are those assigned to the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of the Company without third-party credit enhancement, and any rating assigned to any other debt security of the Company shall be disregarded. The ratings in effect for
any day are those in effect at the close of business on such day.  If the Company has split ratings from Moodys, S&P and Fitch,
(i) if such ratings are in two adjacent categories, pricing will be based on the category in which two of such ratings fall and (ii) if such ratings are in three different categories, pricing will be based on the second highest of such
ratings. If any one of Moodys, S&P and Fitch shall not have a rating in effect with respect to the Company, then (i) if the remaining two ratings fall within the same category, pricing shall be based on that category and (ii) if
the remaining two ratings fall within different categories, 





 
pricing shall be based on the higher of such categories. If the rating system of Moodys, S&P and/or Fitch shall change, or if any such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of
rating corporate debt obligations, the Company and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Lenders) shall negotiate in good faith to amend the LIBOR Margin and Facility Fee definitions to reflect such changed
rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the rating of such rating agency most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation shall be used in determining
pricing.

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
 
[Date]
 
 
[Employee Name and Address]
 
Subject:  Enhancement of Severance Benefit
 
Dear [Name of Employee]:
 
I am pleased to inform you of the approval by the Board of Directors of PCTEL, Inc. (the “Company”) on May 27, 2021 of the enhancement of the severance benefit provided to you pursuant to the severance benefit letter between you and the Company dated [insert date] (the “Prior Severance Benefits Letter”) related to continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA (as defined below). Upon the conditions set forth below, the Company will pay the entire cost of COBRA premiums for the period indicated rather than requiring you to continue to pay the portion thereof equivalent to the portion employees pay for their health insurance benefits. In order to receive this enhanced benefit, please execute this severance benefits letter agreement (“Letter Agreement”) which will supersede the Prior Severance Benefits Letter. You are hereinafter referred to as “Employee”. 
Severance Benefits
(a)Termination by Company Without Cause and Apart From Change of Control.  If, either prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control or after the twelve (12) month period following a Change of Control, Employee's employment is terminated (A) involuntarily by the Company for reasons other than Cause, death or Disability, or (B) by Employee pursuant to a Voluntary Termination for Good Reason, then Employee shall be entitled to receive the following benefits from the Company:


 

(i)

Salary Continuation.  Employee shall continue to receive Employee's then current Base Salary for a period of twelve (12) months following Employee's termination of employment by the Company for reasons other than Cause. All such severance payments shall be paid in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices.  Such continuation of Employee's Base Salary shall be in lieu of any and all other benefits which Employee is entitled to receive on the date of Employee's termination of employment pursuant to any Company severance and benefit plans and practices or pursuant to other agreements with the Company.  Employee shall not be entitled to pro-rated payment of an annual bonus.


 

(ii)

Benefits.  Provided that Employee receives health insurance benefits (i.e., medical, dental and/or vision) through the Company on the date of Employee’s termination by the Company for reasons other than Cause (the “Termination Date”) and elects continuation coverage pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”), within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA, the Company will pay the cost of COBRA premiums for continued health coverage for Employee and any eligible dependents covered by Employee’s health insurance benefits immediately prior to the Termination Date at the same level of coverage as was provided to Employee immediately prior to the Termination Date. The Company shall continue to pay the cost of the COBRA premiums until the earlier of (A) twelve (12) months following the Termination Date, and (B) the date upon which Employee or Employee’s dependents become covered under another employer’s group health, dental and vision insurance benefit plans.  For purposes of Title X of COBRA, the date of the qualifying event for Employee and his/her dependents shall be the Termination Date.  Employee agrees to notify a representative of the Human Resources Department 

 


 


of the date upon which Employee or Employee’s dependents become covered under another employer’s group health, dental and vision insurance benefit plans if such date occurs prior to the end of the period specified in clause (A) above.


 

(iii)

Partial Accelerated Vesting.  All equity awards from the Company then held by Employee shall partially accelerate, or if Employee is then holding unvested shares, Company’s right to repurchase the then-unvested shares under each such equity award shall partially lapse, with respect to the number of shares under each such award that would have become vested or been released from such repurchase right under each respective equity award if Employee’s employment with the Company had continued for an additional twelve (12) months following Employee’s effective termination date for reasons other than Cause.


(b)

Termination Following a Change of Control.  If Employee’s employment is terminated within twelve (12) months following a Change of Control, the severance and other benefits to which Employee is entitled, if any, shall be governed by the Management Retention Agreement, as amended and restated (which includes the definition of Change of Control).


(c)

Other Termination. If Employee's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by Employee for any reason, including death or Disability but other than pursuant to a Voluntary Termination for Good Reason, then Employee shall not be entitled to receive the severance and other benefits discussed above, but may be eligible for those benefits (if any) as may then be required by law or established under the Company's severance and benefit plans and policies existing at the time of such termination.
Separation Agreement and Release.  The receipt of any severance payments or benefits pursuant to this Letter Agreement will be subject to Employee signing, delivering and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company), provided that such separation agreement and release of claims is effective within sixty (60) days following the Termination Date.  No severance pursuant to this Letter Agreement will be paid or provided until the separation agreement and release of claims becomes effective.  If the 60th day after the Termination Date is in the subsequent calendar year, no payment will be made prior to January 1 of such subsequent calendar year.  If Employee should die before all of the severance amounts have been paid, such unpaid amounts will be paid in a lump sum payment promptly following such event to Employee’s designated beneficiary, if living, or otherwise to the personal representative of Employee’s estate.
Section 409A Compliance.  To the extent (i) the requirements for the “short term deferral” rule and/or the “separation pay plan” rule are not satisfied, and (ii) Employee is a “specified employee” of the Company (or any successor entity thereto) within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) on the date of Employee’s termination (other than a termination due to death), then the portion of the severance payments payable to Employee, if any, under this Agreement, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that is deemed a deferral of compensation under Section 409A shall be delayed until the earlier of: (A) the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the date of termination, or (B) the date of Employee’s death (such date, the “Delayed Initial Payment Date”), and the Company (or the successor entity thereto) shall (x) pay to Employee a lump sum equal to the amount Employee would have otherwise received on or before the Delayed Initial Payment Date, without any adjustment on account of such delay, as if the payments had not been delayed pursuant to this section, and (y) pay the balance of the payments in accordance with any applicable payment schedules set forth herein.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Employee dies following her termination, but prior to the six (6) month anniversary of Employee’s Termination Date, then any payments which have been delayed in accordance with this clause will be payable in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the date of Employee’s death.
Definition of Terms:
The following terms referred to in this Letter Agreement shall have the following meanings:
 
Base Salary. “Base Salary” shall mean an amount equal to the Employee's Company annual salaried compensation.

 

Cause. “Cause” shall mean:
(i) any material act (that remains uncured for thirty (30) days following written notice from the Company) which permits the Company to terminate a written employment agreement or similar arrangement between Employee and the Company, for “cause” or a substantially equivalent term as defined in such agreement or arrangement, or 
(ii) in the event there is no such agreement or arrangement, or the agreement or arrangement does not define the term “cause” or a substantially equivalent term, then “Cause” means: (A) an act of personal dishonesty taken by Employee in connection with her responsibilities as an employee and intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of Employee, (B) Employee being convicted of, or a plea of nolo contendere to, a felony, (C) a willful act by Employee which constitutes gross misconduct and which is injurious to the Company, or (D) following delivery to Employee of a written demand for performance from the Company which describes the basis for the Company's reasonable belief that Employee has not substantially performed her duties, continued violations by Employee of Employee's obligations to the Company which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on Employee's part.
Change of Control. “Change of Control” is as defined in the Management Retention Agreement (as amended and restated) entered into between Company and Employee. 
Disability.  “Disability” shall mean:
(i) Executive is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months;
(ii) Executive is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, receiving income replacement benefits for at least three (3) months under the Company’s accident and health plan; or 
(iii) Executive is determined to be totally disabled by the Social Security Administration.
Voluntary Termination for Good Reason.  “Voluntary Termination for Good Reason” shall mean that Employee voluntarily resigns within thirty (30) days following the expiration of any cure period (as discussed below) after the occurrence, without Employee’s written consent, of any of the following events:  
(i) a material diminution by the Company in the Base Salary of Employee as in effect immediately prior to such reduction (other than a reduction that applies to Company officers and/or managers generally);
(ii) a material change in the geographic location at which Employee must perform service (in other words, the relocation of Employee to a facility or a location more than fifty (50) miles from Employee’s then present location); or 
(iii) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement; 
provided, however, that before Employee’s employment may be terminated by a Voluntary Termination for Good Reason:
(A) Employee must provide written notice to the Company, within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the Voluntary Termination for Good Reason condition, setting forth the reasons for Employee’s intention to terminate her employment as a result of a Voluntary Termination for Good Reason; and 
(B) the Company must have an opportunity within thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice to cure the Voluntary Termination for Good Reason condition.  
 

 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, the voluntary resignation by Employee after the occurrence of either of the following shall not constitute grounds for a “Voluntary Termination for Good Reason”:  
 
(1) a reduction of the Employee’s duties, title, authority or responsibilities, relative to the Employee’s duties, title, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to such reduction, as a result of (i) the Company being acquired and made part of a larger entity, (ii) a restructuring of the Company and/or its subsidiaries, or a restructuring of the Company’s employees’ functions, and/or reporting relationships; or 
(2) a material reduction of the facilities or perquisites (including office space and location) available to the Employee immediately prior to such reduction.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company agrees that it will not materially reduce Employee’s aggregate level of employee benefits, including bonuses, to which Employee was entitled immediately prior to such reduction with the result that Employee’s aggregate benefits package is materially reduced (other than a reduction that generally applies to Company officers and/or managers).
 
Please indicate your acceptance of the foregoing by signing and returning to me a copy of this Letter Agreement.  
 
Very truly yours,
